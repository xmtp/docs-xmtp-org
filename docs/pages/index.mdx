<p>ðŸ§ª The XMTP MLS SDKs are in **beta** status and ready for you to start experimenting with. We do **not** recommend using beta software in production apps. Software in this status will change as we add features, rename functions, and iterate based on feedback.</p>
<br/>
<p>XMTP MLS includes breaking changes from V2, most of which will be mitigated by the SDKs. Guidance about the migration path from V2 to V3 will be delivered in forthcoming XMTP MLS release notes.</p>
