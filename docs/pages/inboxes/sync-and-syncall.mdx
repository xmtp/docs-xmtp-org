# Sync conversations, messages, and local installation state

:::tip[Note]
Syncing can't refetch existing conversations, messages, or instllation state group updates. It also can't fetch messages for group chats a user is no longer a member of.

## Sync a specific conversation

Get all new messages and group updates (name, description, etc.) for a specific conversation from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversation.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversation.sync()
```

:::

## Sync new conversations

Get any new group chat or DM conversations from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.sync()
```

## Sync conversations, messages, and local installation state

Sync group chat and DM conversations, messages, and local state across a user's installations. This includes [installation state group](/inboxes/history-sync#installation-state-group) updates (consent states, HMAC keys, and history transfer requests). We recommend that you run this sync in the background and call it more frequently than not.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.syncAll();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.syncAll();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.syncAllConversations();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.syncAllConversations()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.syncAllConversations()
```

## Sync an installation state group

An [installation state group](/inboxes/history-sync#installation-state-group) is a special Messaging Layer Security group that includes all of a user's installations (devices). Its primary role is to deliver installation-related updates (consent states, HMAC keys, and history transfer requests) across a user's multiple installations. Use this dedicated operation to update the installation state group without needing to call the full `syncAll` process.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.syncGroup.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.syncGroup.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.syncGroup.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.syncGroup.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.syncGroup.sync()
```
