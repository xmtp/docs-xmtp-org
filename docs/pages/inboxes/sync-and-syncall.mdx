# Sync conversations and messages

:::tip[Note]
Syncing does not refetch existing conversations and messages. It also does not fetch messages for group chats you are no longer a part of.

## Sync a specific conversation

Get all new messages and group updates (name, description, etc.) for a specific conversation from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversation.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversation.sync()
```

:::code-group

```js [Browser]

```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.sync();

## Sync all new conversations, messages, and updates

Sync all new group chat and DM conversations, messages, and installation-related updates (consent states, HMAC keys, etc.) from the network.

By default, conversations with a consent state of `denied` are filtered out.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.syncAll();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.syncAll();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.syncAllConversations();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.syncAllConversations()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.syncAllConversations()
```
