# Sync conversations, messages, and device groups

:::tip[Note]
Syncing can't refetch existing conversations, messages, or device group updates. It also can't fetch messages for group chats a user is no longer a member of.

## Sync a specific conversation

Get all new messages and group updates (name, description, etc.) for a specific conversation from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversation.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversation.sync()
```

:::

## Sync new conversations

Get any new group chat or DM conversations from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.sync()
```

## Sync conversations and messages

Sync group chat and DM conversations and messages. We recommend that you run this sync in the background and call it more frequently than not.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.syncAll();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.syncAll();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.syncAllConversations();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.syncAllConversations()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.syncAllConversations()
```

## Sync a device group

A [device group](/inboxes/history-sync#device-group) is a special Messaging Layer Security group that includes all of a user's devices. Its primary role is to deliver updates (consent states, HMAC keys, and consent and message archive requests) across a user's multiple devices.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.syncGroup.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.syncGroup.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.syncGroup.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.syncGroup.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.syncGroup.sync()
```
