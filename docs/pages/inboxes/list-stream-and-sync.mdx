# List, stream, and sync conversations and messages

## List existing group chats or DMs

Get a list of existing group chats or DMs in the local database. By default, the conversations are listed in descending order by their `lastMessage` created at value. If a conversation does not contain any messages, the conversation is ordered by its `createdAt` value.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const allConversations = await client.conversations.list();
const allGroups = await client.conversations.listGroups();
const allDms = await client.conversations.listDms();
```

```js [Node]
const allConversations = await client.conversations.list();
const allGroups = await client.conversations.listGroups();
const allDms = await client.conversations.listDms();
```

```tsx [React Native]
// List Conversation items
await alix.conversations.list();

// List Conversation items and return only the fields set to true. Optimize data transfer
// by requesting only the fields the app needs.
await alix.conversations.list(
  {
    members: false,
    consentState: false,
    description: false,
    creatorInboxId: false,
    addedByInboxId: false,
    isActive: false,
    lastMessage: true,
  },
);
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
// List conversations (both groups and dms)
val conversations = alix.conversations.list()
val orderFilteredConversations = client.conversations.list(consentState: ALLOWED)

// List just dms
val conversations = alix.conversations.listDms()
val orderFilteredConversations = client.conversations.listDms(consentState: ALLOWED)

//List just groups
val conversations = alix.conversations.listGroups()
val orderFilteredConversations = client.conversations.listGroups(consentState: ALLOWED)

```

```swift [Swift]
// List conversations (both groups and dms)
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.list()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.list(consentState: .allowed)

// List just dms
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.listDms()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.listDms(consentState: .allowed)

//List just groups
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.listGroups()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.listGroups(consentState: .allowed)
```

## List a user's active conversations

The `isActive()` method determines whether the current user is still an active member of a group conversation. For example:

- When a user is added to a group, `isActive()` returns `true` for that user
- When a user is removed from a group, `isActive()` returns `false` for that user

You can use a user's `isActive: true` value as a filter parameter when listing conversations. You can potentially have a separate section for "archived" or "inactive" conversations where you could use `isActive: false`.

## Stream all group chats and DMs

Listens to the network for new group chats and DMs. Whenever a new conversation starts, it triggers the provided callback function with a [`ConversationContainer` object](#conversationcontainer-interface). This allows the client to immediately respond to any new group chats or DMs initiated by other users.

:::code-group

```js [Node]
const stream = await client.conversations.stream();
// to stream only groups, use `client.conversations.streamGroups()`
// to stream only dms, use `client.conversations.streamDms()`

try {
  for await (const conversation of stream) {
    // Received a conversation
  }
} catch (error) {
  // log any stream errors
  console.error(error);
}
```

```tsx [React Native]
await alix.conversations.stream(async (conversation: Conversation<any>) => {
  // Received a conversation
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
alix.conversations.stream(type: /* OPTIONAL DMS, GROUPS, ALL */).collect {
  // Received a conversation
}
```

```swift [Swift]
for await convo in try await alix.conversations.stream(type: /* OPTIONAL .dms, .groups, .all */) {
  // Received a conversation
}
```

## Stream all group chat and DM messages

Listens to the network for new messages within all active group chats and DMs. Whenever a new message is sent to any of these conversations, the callback is triggered with a `DecodedMessage` object. This keeps the inbox up to date by streaming in messages as they arrive.

:::warning[Important]

The stream is infinite. Therefore, any looping construct used with the stream won't terminate unless you explicitly initiate the termination. You can initiate the termination by breaking the loop or by making an external call to `return`.

:::

:::code-group

```js [Node]
// stream all messages from all conversations
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllMessages();

// stream only group messages
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllGroupMessages();

// stream only dm messages
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllDmMessages();

try {
  for await (const message of stream) {
    // Received a message
  }
} catch (error) {
  // log any stream errors
  console.error(error);
}
```

```tsx [React Native]
await alix.conversations.streamAllMessages(
  async (message: DecodedMessage<any>) => {
    // Received a message
  }
);
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
alix.conversations.streamAllMessages(type: /* OPTIONAL DMS, GROUPS, ALL */).collect {
  // Received a message
}
```

```swift [Swift]
for await message in try await alix.conversations.streamAllMessages(type: /* OPTIONAL .dms, .groups, .all */) {
  // Received a message
}

## Sync

### ðŸŽ¥ walkthrough: Syncing

This video provides a walkthrough of syncing, covering the key ideas discussed in this doc. After watching, feel free to continue reading for more details.

:::tip[Note]
Syncing does not refetch existing conversations and messages. It also does not fetch messages for group chats you are no longer a part of.

### Sync conversation

Get all new messages and group updates (name, description, etc.) for a specific conversation from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversation.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversation.sync()
```

:::

## Sync conversations

Get any new group chat or DM conversations from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.sync()
```

## Sync all new conversations, messages, and updates

Sync all new group chat and DM conversations, messages, and installation-related updates (consent states, HMAC keys, etc.) from the network. We recommend that you run this sync in the background and call it more frequently than not.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.syncAll();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.syncAll();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.syncAllConversations();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.syncAllConversations()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.syncAllConversations()
```

## Handle unsupported content types

As more [custom](/inboxes/content-types/content-types#create-a-custom-content-type) and [standards-track](/inboxes/content-types/content-types#standards-track-content-types) content types are introduced into the XMTP ecosystem, your app may encounter content types it does not support. This situation, if not handled properly, could lead to app crashes.

Each message is accompanied by a `fallback` property, which offers a descriptive string representing the content type's expected value. It's important to note that fallbacks are immutable and are predefined in the content type specification. In instances where `fallback` is `undefined`, such as read receipts, it indicates that the content is not intended to be rendered. If you're venturing into creating custom content types, you're provided with the flexibility to specify a custom fallback string. For a deeper dive into this, see [Build custom content types](/inboxes/content-types/custom).

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const codec = client.codecFor(content.contentType);
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback !== undefined) {
    return message.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```js [Node]
const codec = client.codecFor(content.contentType);
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback !== undefined) {
    return message.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```jsx [React Native]
//contentTypeID has the following structure `${contentType.authorityId}/${contentType.typeId}:${contentType.versionMajor}.${contentType.versionMinor}`;
const isRegistered = message.contentTypeID in client.codecRegistry;
if (!isRegistered) {
  // Not supported content type
  if (message?.fallback != null) {
    return message?.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val codec = client.codecRegistry.find(options?.contentType)
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback != null) {
    return message.fallback
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```swift [Swift]
let codec = client.codecRegistry.find(for: contentType)
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback != null) {
    return message.fallback
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```
