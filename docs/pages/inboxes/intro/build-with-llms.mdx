# Use XMTP documentation with AI coding assistants

To make it easier to use AI coding agents to build with XMTP, you can find an `llms-full.txt` file at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-full.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-full.txt).

This `llms-full.txt` file includes all XMTP documentation in a single plain text file for easy parsing by AI agents.

If youâ€™re using an LLM tool that allows custom context, you can upload or point to `llms-full.txt` to enhance your AI coding experience with XMTP.
