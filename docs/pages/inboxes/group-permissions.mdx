# Manage group permissions

Robust group chat permissions are key to providing users with a friendly and safe group chat experience.

## Understand the group permissions system

### Member statuses

Member statuses are the roles that can be assigned to each participant (inbox ID) in a group chat. These are the available member statuses:

- Member
  - Everyone in a group chat is a member. A member can be granted admin or super admin status. If a member's admin or super admin status is removed, they are still a member of the group.
- Admin
- Super admin

### Options

Use options to assign a role to a permission. These are the available options:

- All members
- Admin only
    - Includes super admins
- Super admin only

### Permissions

Permissions are the actions a group chat participant can be allowed to take. These are the available permissions:

- Grant admin status to a member
- Remove admin status from a member
- Add a member to the group
- Remove a member from the group
- Update [group metadata](/inboxes/group-metadata), such as group name, description, and image
- Update group permissions on an item-by-item basis, such as calling `updateGroupNamePermission` or`updateAddMemberPermission` . To learn more, see [Group.kt](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-android/blob/main/library/src/main/java/org/xmtp/android/library/Group.kt#L251-L313) in the xmtp-android SDK repo.

The following permissions can be assigned by super admins only. This helps ensure that a “regular” admin cannot remove the super admin or otherwise destroy a group.

- Grant super admin status to a member
- Remove super admin status from a member

## How the group permissions system works

When a group is created, all groups have the same permissions and options set:

- There is one super admin, and it is the group creator
- There are no admins
- Each user added to the group starts out as a member

The super admin has all of the [available permissions](#permissions) and can use them to adjust the group’s permissions and options.

As the app developer, you can provide a UI that enables group participants to make further adjustments. For example, you can give the super admin the following options when creating the group:

- Add members
- Update group metadata

<div>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/group-perm-toggles.png" width="300px" />
</div>

You can use member statuses, options, and permissions to create a custom policy set.

If you aren’t opinionated and don’t set any permissions and options, groups will default to using the delivered `All_Members` policy set, which applies the following permissions and options:

- Add member - All members
- Remove member - Admin only
- Add admin - Super admin only
- Remove admin - Super admin only
- Update group permissions - Super admin only
- Update group metadata - All members

To learn more about the `All_Members` and `Admin_Only` policy sets, see [group_permissions.rs](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/blob/85dd6d36f46db1ed74fe98273eea6871fea2e078/xmtp_mls/src/groups/group_permissions.rs#L1192-L1226) in the LibXMTP repo.

## Manage group chat admins

By design, checking admin permission status by wallet address is not supported. Instead, look up the `inboxID` for that wallet address, then use the calls below.

### Check if inbox ID is an admin

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const isAdmin = group.isAdmin(inboxId);
```

```js [Node]
const isAdmin = group.isAdmin(inboxId);
```

```tsx [React Native]
// Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
const isAdmin = await.group.isAdmin(adminClient.inboxID);
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
//Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
val isInboxIDAdmin = group.isAdmin(inboxId)
```

```swift [Swift]
// Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
try group.isAdmin(client.inboxID)
```

:::

### Check if inbox ID is a super admin

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const isSuperAdmin = group.isSuperAdmin(inboxId);
```

```js [Node]
const isSuperAdmin = group.isSuperAdmin(inboxId);
```

```tsx [React Native]
//Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
const isSuperAdmin = await group.isSuperAdmin(client.inboxID);
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
//Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
val isInboxIDSuperAdmin = group.isSuperAdmin(inboxId)
```

```swift [Swift]
try group.isSuperAdmin(inboxid: inboxID)
```

### List admins

:::code-group

```js [Browser]

group.listAdmins()
```

try group.listAdmins()
```

### SDK method call flow to add and remove members

![Add and remove members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/docs/pages/img/add-remove.png)

When you add or remove members from a group, a proposal/commit message is sent to all the installations in the group. When the commit happens, the cryptographic state of the group is changed. This allows new members to receive messages but not decrypt older ones and prevents removed members from decrypting messages after their departure.
