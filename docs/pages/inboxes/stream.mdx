# Stream conversations, messages, and preference updates

## Stream new group chat and DM conversations

Listens to the network for new group chats and DMs. Whenever a new conversation starts, it triggers the provided callback function with a [`ConversationContainer` object](/inboxes/create-conversations#conversation-helper-methods). This allows the client to immediately respond to any new group chats or DMs initiated by other users.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const stream = await client.conversations.stream();

try {
  for await (const conversation of stream) {
    // Received a conversation
    console.log("New conversation:", conversation);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Log any stream errors
  console.error(error);
}
```

```js [Node]
const stream = await client.conversations.stream();
// to stream only groups, use `client.conversations.streamGroups()`
// to stream only dms, use `client.conversations.streamDms()`

try {
  for await (const conversation of stream) {
    // Received a conversation
  }
} catch (error) {
  // log any stream errors
  console.error(error);
}
```

```tsx [React Native]
await alix.conversations.stream(async (conversation: Conversation<any>) => {
  // Received a conversation
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
alix.conversations.stream(type: /* OPTIONAL DMS, GROUPS, ALL */).collect {
  // Received a conversation
}
```

```swift [Swift]
for await convo in try await alix.conversations.stream(type: /* OPTIONAL .dms, .groups, .all */) {
  // Received a conversation
}

## Stream new group chat and DM messages and preference updates

This function listens to the network for new messages within all active group chats and DMs, as well as [preference updates](/inboxes/sync-preferences). 

Whenever a new message is sent to any of these conversations, the callback is triggered with a `DecodedMessage` object. This keeps the inbox up to date by streaming in messages as they arrive.

By default, `streamAll` streams only conversations with a [consent state](/inboxes/user-consent/user-consent#how-user-consent-preferences-are-set) of allowed or unknown.

We recommend streaming messages for allowed conversations only. This ensures that spammy conversations with a consent state of unknown don't take up networking resources. This also ensures that unwanted spam messages aren't stored in the user's local database.

To stream all conversations regardless of consent state, pass `[Allowed, Unknown, Denied]`.

:::warning[Important]

The stream is infinite. Therefore, any looping construct used with the stream won't terminate unless you explicitly initiate the termination. You can initiate the termination by breaking the loop or by making an external call to `return`.

try {
  for await (const message of stream) {
    // Received a message
    console.log("New message:", message);

  // Log any stream errors
