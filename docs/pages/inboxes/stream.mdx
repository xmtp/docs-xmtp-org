# Stream conversations and messages

## Stream all group chat and DM messages and preferences

Listens to the network for new messages within all active group chats and DMs, as well as [preference updates](/inboxes/sync-preferences). 

Whenever a new message is sent to any of these conversations, the callback is triggered with a `DecodedMessage` object. This keeps the inbox up to date by streaming in messages as they arrive.

By default, `streamAll` streams only conversations with a [consent state](/inboxes/user-consent/user-consent#how-user-consent-preferences-are-set) of allowed or unknown.

We recommend streaming messages for allowed conversations only. This ensures that spammy conversations with a consent state of unknown don't take up networking resources. This also ensures that unwanted spam messages aren't stored in the user's local database.

To stream all conversations regardless of consent state, pass `[Allowed, Unknown, Denied]`.

:::warning[Important]

The stream is infinite. Therefore, any looping construct used with the stream won't terminate unless you explicitly initiate the termination. You can initiate the termination by breaking the loop or by making an external call to `return`.

## Handle unsupported content types

As more [custom](/inboxes/content-types/content-types#create-a-custom-content-type) and [standards-track](/inboxes/content-types/content-types#standards-track-content-types) content types are introduced into the XMTP ecosystem, your app may encounter content types it does not support. This situation, if not handled properly, could lead to app crashes.

Each message is accompanied by a `fallback` property, which offers a descriptive string representing the content type's expected value. It's important to note that fallbacks are immutable and are predefined in the content type specification. In instances where `fallback` is `undefined`, such as read receipts, it indicates that the content is not intended to be rendered. If you're venturing into creating custom content types, you're provided with the flexibility to specify a custom fallback string. For a deeper dive into this, see [Build custom content types](/inboxes/content-types/custom).

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const codec = client.codecFor(content.contentType);
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback !== undefined) {
    return message.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```js [Node]
const codec = client.codecFor(content.contentType);
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback !== undefined) {
    return message.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```jsx [React Native]
//contentTypeID has the following structure `${contentType.authorityId}/${contentType.typeId}:${contentType.versionMajor}.${contentType.versionMinor}`;
const isRegistered = message.contentTypeID in client.codecRegistry;
if (!isRegistered) {
  // Not supported content type
  if (message?.fallback != null) {
    return message?.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val codec = client.codecRegistry.find(options?.contentType)
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback != null) {
    return message.fallback
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```swift [Swift]
let codec = client.codecRegistry.find(for: contentType)
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback != null) {
    return message.fallback
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```
