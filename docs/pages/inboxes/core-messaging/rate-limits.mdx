# Observe rate limits

XMTP enforces separate rate limits for read and write operations per client per rolling 5-minute window:

- **Read operations**: 20,000 requests per 5-minute window
- **Write operations**: 3,000 messages published per 5-minute window

When you reach either rate limit, your API calls will be rejected with a 429 (Too Many Requests) error.

**Read operations** include actions like:

- Fetching conversations
- Retrieving messages
- Getting inbox state
- Listing installations

**Write operations** include actions like:

- Sending chat messages
- Adding and removing wallets
- Adding and revoking installations
- Adding and removing group members
- Updating group metadata
