# Create an XMTP client

Create an XMTP MLS client that can use the signing capabilities provided by the `SigningKey` parameter. This `SigningKey` links the client to the appropriate EOA or SCW.

## Create a client

:::code-group

```tsx [Browser]
import { Client, type Signer } from "@xmtp/browser-sdk";

const accountIdentity = {
  kind: "ETHEREUM", // Specifies the identity type
  identifier: "0x...", // Ethereum address as the identifier
};

const signer: Signer = {
  getIdentity: () => accountIdentity,
  signMessage: async (message) => {
    // return value from a signing method here
  },
};

// This value should be generated once per installation and stored securely
const encryptionKey = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32));

const client = await Client.create(
  signer,
  encryptionKey,
  options /* optional */
);
```

```tsx [Node]
import { Client, type Signer } from "@xmtp/node-sdk";
import { getRandomValues } from "node:crypto";

const accountIdentity = {
  kind: "ETHEREUM", // Specifies the identity type
  identifier: "0x...", // Ethereum address as the identifier
};

const signer: Signer = {
  getIdentity: () => accountIdentity,
  signMessage: async (message) => {
    // return value from a signing method here
  },
};

// This value should be generated once per installation and stored securely
const encryptionKey = getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32));

const client = await Client.create(
  signer,
  encryptionKey,
  options /* optional */
);
```

```tsx [React Native]
Client.create(SigningKey, {
  env: "production", // 'local' | 'dev' | 'production'
  dbEncryptionKey: keyBytes, // 32 bytes
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val options = ClientOptions(
    ClientOptions.Api(XMTPEnvironment.PRODUCTION, true),
    appContext = ApplicationContext(),
    dbEncryptionKey = keyBytes // 32 bytes
)
val client = Client().create(
        account = SigningKey,
        options = options
    )
```

```swift [Swift]
let options = ClientOptions.init(
  api: .init(env: .production, isSecure: true),
  dbEncryptionKey: keyBytes // 32 bytes
)
let client = try await Client.create(
  account: SigningKey,
  options: options
)
```

:::

When an app first callsÂ `Client.create()`, a client creates a local database to manage messaging between the app and the network. In subsequent calls, it loads the existing database. The database is encrypted using the keys from theÂ `Signer`Â interface.

To learn more about database operations, see theÂ [XMTP MLS protocol spec](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/blob/main/xmtp_mls/README.md).

### Configure an XMTP client

You can configure an XMTP client with these parameters of `Client.create`:

| Parameter       | Default                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| env             | `DEV`                                           | Connect to the specified XMTP network environment. Valid values include `DEV`, `PRODUCTION`, or `LOCAL`. For important details about working with these environments, see [XMTP DEV and PRODUCTION network environments](#xmtp-dev-and-production-network-environments). |
| apiURL             | undefined                                           | Manually specify an API URL to use. If specified, value of `env` will be ignored. |
| appContext (Android-only)     | null                                      | Required. The app context used to create and access the local database. |
| dbEncryptionKey | null                                      | Required. A 32-byte `ByteArray` used to encrypt the local database.    |
| dbDirectory | xmtp_db                                      | Optional. Specify a database directory. If no directory is specified, the value is set to `xmtp_db` by default. |
| historySyncUrl  | `https://message-history.dev.ephemera.network/` | The history sync URL used to specify where history can be synced from other devices on the network. For production apps, use `https://message-history.production.ephemera.network`. |

### XMTP DEV and PRODUCTION network environments

XMTP provides `DEV` and `PRODUCTION` network environments to support the development phases of your project.

The `PRODUCTION` and `DEV` networks are completely separate and not interchangeable.

For example, an XMTP identity on the `DEV` network is completely distinct from the XMTP identity on the `PRODUCTION` network, as are the messages associated with these identities. In addition, XMTP identities and messages created on the `DEV` network can't be accessed from or moved to the `PRODUCTION` network, and vice versa.

:::tip
When you [create a client](/inboxes/create-a-client), it connects to the XMTP `DEV` environment by default. Use the `env` parameter to explicitly set your client's network environment.
:::

Here are some best practices for when to use each environment:

- `DEV`: Use to have a client communicate with the `DEV` network. As a best practice, set `env` to `DEV` while developing and testing your app. Follow this best practice to isolate test messages to `DEV` inboxes.

- `PRODUCTION`: Use to have a client communicate with the `PRODUCTION` network. As a best practice, set `env` to `PRODUCTION` when your app is serving real users. Follow this best practice to isolate messages between real-world users to `PRODUCTION` inboxes.

The `PRODUCTION` network is configured to store messages indefinitely. XMTP may occasionally delete messages and keys from the `DEV` network, and will provide advance notice in the [XMTP Community Forms](https://community.xmtp.org/).

You can also use a `LOCAL` value to have a client communicate with an XMTP node you are running locally. For example, an XMTP node developer can set `env` to `LOCAL` to generate client traffic to test a node running locally.

## Build an existing client

Build, or resume, an existing client that's logged in and has an existing local database.

:::code-group

```tsx [React Native]
Client.build(identity, {
  env: "production", // 'local' | 'dev' | 'production'
  dbEncryptionKey: keyBytes, // 32 bytes
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val options = ClientOptions(
    ClientOptions.Api(XMTPEnvironment.PRODUCTION, true),
    appContext = ApplicationContext(),
    dbEncryptionKey = keyBytes
)
val client = Client().build(
        identity = identity,
        options = options
    )
```

```swift [Swift]
let options = ClientOptions.init(
  api: .init(env: .production, isSecure: true),
  dbEncryptionKey: keyBytes // 32 bytes
)
let client = try await Client.build(
  identity: identity,
  options: options
)
```

:::

## Log out a client

When you log a user out of your app, you can give them the option to delete their local database.

:::tip[Important]
If the user chooses to delete their local database, they will have to create a new installation the next time they log in and will lose all of their messages.
:::

:::code-group

```tsx [React Native]
  await client.deleteLocalDatabase()
  await Client.dropClient(client.installationId)
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
  client.deleteLocalDatabase()
```

```swift [Swift]
  try await client.deleteLocalDatabase()
```
