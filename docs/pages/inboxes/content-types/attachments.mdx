description: Learn how to use the attachment and remote attachment content types to support attachments in your app built with XMTP

# Support attachments in your app built with XMTP

Use the remote attachment or attachment content type to support attachments in your app.

- Use the [remote attachment content type](#support-remote-attachments-of-any-size) to send attachments of any size.

- Use the [attachment content type](#support-attachments-smaller-than-1mb) to send attachments smaller than 1MB.

## Support remote attachments of any size

Remote attachments of any size can be sent using the `RemoteAttachmentCodec` and a storage provider.

### Install the package

```bash
npm i @xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment
```

> In some SDKs, the `AttachmentCodec` is already included in the SDK. If not, you can install the package using the following command:

### Configure the content type

After importing the package, you can register the codec.

:::code-group

```jsx [React Native]
const client = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: "production",
  codecs: [new RemoteAttachmentCodec(), new StaticAttachmentCodec()],
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.Attachment
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.AttachmentCodec
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ContentTypeAttachment

Client.register(codec = AttachmentCodec())
Client.register(codec = RemoteAttachmentCodec())
```

```swift [Swift]
Client.register(AttachmentCodec());
Client.register(RemoteAttachmentCodec());
```

### Send a remote attachment

:::code-group

<div data-title="React Native">

This method takes a `DecryptedLocalAttachment` object as an argument:

```jsx [JavaScript]
const { encryptedLocalFileUri, metadata } = await alice.encryptAttachment({
  fileUri: `file://${file}`,
  mimeType: "text/plain",
});
```

Upload an encrypted file to a remote server:

```jsx [JavaScript]
let url = await uploadFile(encryptedLocalFileUri);
```

Send a remote attachment message:

```jsx [JavaScript]
await convo.send({
  remoteAttachment: {
    ...metadata,
    scheme: "https://",
    url,
  },
});
```

</div>

<div data-title="Kotlin">

Create an attachment object:

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val attachment = Attachment(
filename = "test.txt",
mimeType = "text/plain",
data = "hello world".toByteStringUtf8(),
)
```

Encode and encrypt an attachment for transport:

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val encodedEncryptedContent = RemoteAttachment.encodeEncrypted(
content = attachment,
codec = AttachmentCodec(),
)
```

Create a remote attachment from an attachment:

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val remoteAttachment = RemoteAttachment.from(
    encryptedEncodedContent = encodedEncryptedContent
)
remoteAttachment.contentLength = attachment.data.size()
remoteAttachment.filename = attachment.filename
```

Send a remote attachment and set the `contentType`:

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val newConversation = client.conversations.newConversation(walletAddress)

newConversation.send(
content = remoteAttachment,
options = SendOptions(contentType = ContentTypeRemoteAttachment),
)
```

</div>

<div data-title="Swift">

Create an attachment object:

```swift [Swift]
let attachment = Attachment(
  filename: "screenshot.png",
  mimeType: "image/png",
  data: Data(somePNGData)
)
```

Encode and encrypt an attachment for transport:

```swift [Swift]
// Encode an attachment and encrypt the encoded content
const encryptedAttachment = try RemoteAttachment.encodeEncrypted(
	content: attachment,
	codec: AttachmentCodec()
)
```

Upload an encrypted attachment anywhere where it will be accessible via an HTTPS GET request. For example, you can use web3.storage:

```swift [Swift]
func upload(data: Data, token: String): String {
  let url = URL(string: "https://api.web3.storage/upload")!
  var request = URLRequest(url: url)
  request.addValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
  request.addValue("XMTP", forHTTPHeaderField: "X-NAME")
  request.httpMethod = "POST"

  let responseData = try await URLSession.shared.upload(for: request, from: data).0
  let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(Web3Storage.Response.self, from: responseData)

  return "https://\(response.cid).ipfs.w3s.link"
}

let url = upload(data: encryptedAttachment.payload, token: YOUR_WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN)
```

Create a remote attachment from an attachment:

```swift [Swift]
let remoteAttachment = try RemoteAttachment(
  url: url,
  encryptedEncodedContent: encryptedEncodedContent
)
```

Send a remote attachment and set the `contentType`:

```swift [Swift]
try await conversation.send(
	content: remoteAttachment,
	options: .init(
		contentType: ContentTypeRemoteAttachment,
		contentFallback: "a description of the image"
	)
)
```

</div>

### Receive, decode, and decrypt a remote attachment

Now that you can receive a remote attachment, you need a way to receive a remote attachment. For example:

:::code-group

<div data-title="React Native">

On the receiving end, you can use the `decryptAttachment` method to decrypt the downloaded file. This method takes an `EncryptedLocalAttachment` object as an argument and returns a `DecryptedLocalAttachment` object.

```jsx [JavaScript]
if (message.contentTypeId === "xmtp.org/remoteStaticAttachment:1.0") {
  // Now we can decrypt the downloaded file using the message metadata.
  const attached = await xmtp_client.decryptAttachment({
    encryptedLocalFileUri: downloadedFileUri,
    metadata: message.content() as RemoteAttachmentContent,
  })

  //attached.filename
  //attached.mimeType
  //attached.fileUri
}
```

Display the attachment:

```jsx [JavaScript]
<Image source={{ uri: attached.fileUri }} />
```

</div>

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val message = newConversation.messages().first()
val loadedRemoteAttachment: RemoteAttachment = messages.content()
loadedRemoteAttachment.fetcher = Fetcher()
runBlocking {
  val attachment: Attachment = loadedRemoteAttachment.load()
}
```

<div data-title="Swift">

```swift [Swift]
let attachment: Attachment = try await remoteAttachment.content()
```

You now have the original attachment:

```swift [Swift]
attachment.filename // => "screenshot.png"
attachment.mimeType // => "image/png",
attachment.data // => [the PNG data]
```

Once you've created the attachment object, you can create a preview to show in the message input field before sending:

```swift [Swift]
import UIKIt
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
	var body: some View {
		Image(uiImage: UIImage(data: attachment.data))
	}
}
```

</div>

:::

To handle unsupported content types, refer to the [fallback](/inboxes/build-inbox/#handle-unsupported-content-types) section.

## Support attachments smaller than 1MB

Attachments smaller than 1MB can be sent using the `AttachmentCodec`. The codec will automatically encrypt the attachment and upload it to the XMTP network.

:::warning

Unless a very specific use case we recommend using the [remote attachment content type](/inboxes/content-types/attachments) instead since many attachments are larger than 1MB in a messaging app.

### Install the package

```bash
npm i @xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment
```

> In some SDKs, the `AttachmentCodec` is already included in the SDK. If not, you can install the package using the following command:

### Import and register

:::code-group

```jsx [React Native]
const client = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: "production",
  codecs: [new StaticAttachmentCodec()],
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.Attachment
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.AttachmentCodec
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ContentTypeAttachment

Client.register(codec = AttachmentCodec())
```

```swift [Swift]
Client.register(AttachmentCodec());
```

:::

### Load local file

```tsx
// Read local file and extract its details
const file = fs.readFileSync("xmtp.png");
const filename = path.basename("xmtp.png");
const extname = path.extname("xmtp.png");
console.log(`Filename: ${filename}`);
console.log(`File Type: ${extname}`);
```

### Send encrypted file

```tsx
// Convert the file to a Uint8Array
const blob = new Blob([file], { type: extname });
let imgArray = new Uint8Array(await blob.arrayBuffer());

const attachment = {
  filename: filename,
  mimeType: extname, //image, video or audio
  data: imgArray,
};

console.log("Attachment created", attachment);
await conversation.send(attachment, { contentType: ContentTypeAttachment });
```

### Receive encrypted file

```jsx
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeAttachment)) {
  const blobdecoded = new Blob([message.content.data], {
    type: message.content.mimeType,
  });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blobdecoded);
}
```
