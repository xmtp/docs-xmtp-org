# Handle unsupported content types

As more [custom](/inboxes/content-types/content-types#create-a-custom-content-type) and [standards-track](/inboxes/content-types/content-types#standards-track-content-types) content types are introduced into the XMTP ecosystem, your app may encounter content types it does not support. This situation, if not handled properly, could lead to app crashes.

Each message is accompanied by a `fallback` property, which offers a descriptive string representing the content type's expected value. It's important to note that fallbacks are immutable and are predefined in the content type specification. In instances where `fallback` is `undefined`, such as read receipts, it indicates that the content is not intended to be rendered. If you're venturing into creating custom content types, you're provided with the flexibility to specify a custom fallback string. For a deeper dive into this, see [Build custom content types](/inboxes/content-types/custom).

```js [Browser]
const codec = client.codecFor(content.contentType);
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback !== undefined) {
    return message.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```js [Node]
const codec = client.codecFor(content.contentType);
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback !== undefined) {
    return message.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```jsx [React Native]
//contentTypeID has the following structure `${contentType.authorityId}/${contentType.typeId}:${contentType.versionMajor}.${contentType.versionMinor}`;
const isRegistered = message.contentTypeID in client.codecRegistry;
if (!isRegistered) {
  // Not supported content type
  if (message?.fallback != null) {
    return message?.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val codec = client.codecRegistry.find(options?.contentType)
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback != null) {
    return message.fallback
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```swift [Swift]
let codec = client.codecRegistry.find(for: contentType)

  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback != null) {
    return message.fallback
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
