# Sync preferences

Preference sync enables you to sync the following preference-related information across multiple existing app installations:

- Conversation [consent preferences](/inboxes/user-consent/user-consent#how-user-consent-preferences-are-set)
- Conversation HMAC keys (for [push notifications](/inboxes/push-notifs/understand-push-notifs))

## Databases used by preference sync

Each xmtpd node contains:

- A **welcomes database**: Keeps a ledger of all groups an inbox ID is a part of.
- A **group messages database**: Keeps a ledger of all messages in the groups an inbox ID is a part of.

</div>

In the welcomes database, the groups are of these types:

- **1:1 chat**: A group that handles conversations between an inbox ID and one other user.
- **Group chat**: A group that handles conversations between an inbox ID and multiple other users.
- **Preferences**: A group that handles syncing preferences between an inbox ID's existing app installations.

One-to-one chat, group chat, and preferences groups in the welcome database are updated by apps as follows:

- 1:1 chats
    - `conversations.list`
    - `syncAll`
    - `streamAll`
- Group chats
    - `conversations.list`
    - `syncAll`
    - `streamAll`
- Preferences
    - `preferences.sync`
    - `syncAll`
    - `streamAll`

## Preferences group

To describe preference sync, let's first focus on how the preferences group works.

1. A preferences group has one member, which is one inbox ID.
   
2. Let's say Inbox ID Alix has an Installation A of App A on their phone. At this time, Inbox ID Alix has a preferences group that looks like this:

   <div>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/pg-1.png" width="300px" />
   </div>

3. Inbox ID Alix then logs in to an Installation B of App B on their phone. The next time Installation A runs `preferences.sync`, `syncAll`, or `streamAll`, it updates the preferences group as follows:
    
   <div>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/pg-2.png" width="300px" />
   </div>
    
4. Then let's say Inbox ID Alix logs in to an Installation C of App A on their tablet. The next time Installation A or B runs `preferences.sync`, `syncAll`, or `streamAll`, it updates the preferences group as follows:
    
   <div>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/pg-3.png" width="300px" />
   </div>
    
## Preferences sync worker

Now, let's describe how the preferences sync worker helps keep user consent preferences in sync across existing app installations.

1. Let's say Inbox ID Alix uses Installation A to block Inbox ID Bo.

   <div>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/a-block-bo.png" width="200px" />
   </div>    
    
2. This sends a message to the preferences group in the group message database. This is not an actual chat message, but a serialized proto message that is not shown to app users.
    
   <div>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/gm-pg.png" width="300px" />
   </div>    
    
3. When Installation B calls `preferences.sync`, `syncAll`, or `streamAll`, it gets the message from the preferences group. The sync worker listens for these preferences group messages and processes the message to block Inbox ID Bo in Installation B.
    
   <div>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/b-block-bo.png" width="200px" />
   </div> 
    
4. Likewise, when Installation C calls `preferences.sync`, `syncAll`, or `streamAll`, it gets the message from the preferences group, and the sync worker ensures Inbox ID Bo is blocked there as well.
    
   <div>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/c-block-bo.png" width="200px" />
   </div>   

Preferences sync handles syncing HMAC keys in the same way.

For example, it will handle syncing an HMAC key shared by Installation B to other installations. When Installation A and C call `preferences.sync`, `syncAll`, or `streamAll`, the sync worker gets Installation B's HMAC key message from the preferences group and ensures that Installation A and C get the HMAC key for Installation B.

## Sync preferences

Use this call to sync preferences (consent preferences and HMAC keys) across app installations in a preferences group. This will also sync welcomes to ensure that you have all potential new installations before syncing.

This is a lighter-weight alternative to syncing preferences using [`syncAll`](/inboxes/sync-and-syncall#sync-all-new-conversations-messages-and-preferences) or [`streamAll`](/inboxes/list-and-stream#stream-all-group-chat-and-dm-messages-and-preferences).
