# List and stream conversations and messages

## List existing conversations

Get a list of existing group chat and DM conversations in the local database.

By default, `list` returns only conversations with a [consent state](/inboxes/user-consent/user-consent#how-user-consent-preferences-are-set) of allowed or unknown.

We recommend listing allowed conversations only. This ensures that spammy conversations with a consent state of unknown don't degrade the user experience.

To list all conversations regardless of consent state, pass `[ALLOWED, UNKNOWN, DENIED]`.

Conversations are listed in descending order by their `lastMessage` created at value. If a conversation has no messages, the conversation is ordered by its `createdAt` value.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const allConversations = await client.conversations.list(["allowed"]);
const allGroups = await client.conversations.listGroups(["allowed"]);
const allDms = await client.conversations.listDms(["allowed"]);
```

```js [Node]
const allConversations = await client.conversations.list(["allowed"]);
const allGroups = await client.conversations.listGroups(["allowed"]);
const allDms = await client.conversations.listDms(["allowed"]);
```

```tsx [React Native]
// List Conversation items
await alix.conversations.list(["allowed"]);

// List Conversation items and return only the fields set to true. Optimize data transfer
// by requesting only the fields the app needs.
await alix.conversations.list(
  {
    members: false,
    consentState: false,
    description: false,
    creatorInboxId: false,
    addedByInboxId: false,
    isActive: false,
    lastMessage: true,
  },
);
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
// List conversations (both groups and dms)
val conversations = alix.conversations.list()
val orderFilteredConversations = client.conversations.list(consentState: ALLOWED)

// List just dms
val conversations = alix.conversations.listDms()
val orderFilteredConversations = client.conversations.listDms(consentState: ALLOWED)

//List just groups
val conversations = alix.conversations.listGroups()
val orderFilteredConversations = client.conversations.listGroups(consentState: ALLOWED)

```

```swift [Swift]
// List conversations (both groups and dms)
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.list()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.list(consentState: .allowed)

// List just dms
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.listDms()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.listDms(consentState: .allowed)

//List just groups
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.listGroups()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.listGroups(consentState: .allowed)
```

## List a user's active conversations

The `isActive()` method determines whether the current user is still an active member of a group conversation. For example:

- When a user is added to a group, `isActive()` returns `true` for that user
- When a user is removed from a group, `isActive()` returns `false` for that user

You can use a user's `isActive: true` value as a filter parameter when listing conversations. You can potentially have a separate section for "archived" or "inactive" conversations where you could use `isActive: false`.

## Stream all group chats and DMs

Listens to the network for new group chats and DMs. Whenever a new conversation starts, it triggers the provided callback function with a [`ConversationContainer` object](#conversationcontainer-interface). This allows the client to immediately respond to any new group chats or DMs initiated by other users.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const stream = await client.conversations.stream();

try {
  for await (const conversation of stream) {
    // Received a conversation
    console.log("New conversation:", conversation);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Log any stream errors
  console.error(error);
}
```

```js [Node]
const stream = await client.conversations.stream();
// to stream only groups, use `client.conversations.streamGroups()`
// to stream only dms, use `client.conversations.streamDms()`

try {
  for await (const conversation of stream) {
    // Received a conversation
  }
} catch (error) {
  // log any stream errors
  console.error(error);
}
```

```tsx [React Native]
await alix.conversations.stream(async (conversation: Conversation<any>) => {
  // Received a conversation
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
alix.conversations.stream(type: /* OPTIONAL DMS, GROUPS, ALL */).collect {
  // Received a conversation
}
```

```swift [Swift]
for await convo in try await alix.conversations.stream(type: /* OPTIONAL .dms, .groups, .all */) {
  // Received a conversation
}
```

## Stream all group chat and DM messages and preferences

Listens to the network for new messages within all active group chats and DMs, as well as [preference updates](/inboxes/sync-preferences). 

Whenever a new message is sent to any of these conversations, the callback is triggered with a `DecodedMessage` object. This keeps the inbox up to date by streaming in messages as they arrive.

By default, `streamAll` streams only conversations with a [consent state](/inboxes/user-consent/user-consent#how-user-consent-preferences-are-set) of allowed or unknown.

We recommend streaming messages for allowed conversations only. This ensures that spammy conversations with a consent state of unknown don't take up networking resources. This also ensures that unwanted spam messages aren't stored in the user's local database.

To stream all conversations regardless of consent state, pass `[Allowed, Unknown, Denied]`.

:::warning[Important]

The stream is infinite. Therefore, any looping construct used with the stream won't terminate unless you explicitly initiate the termination. You can initiate the termination by breaking the loop or by making an external call to `return`.

```js [Browser]
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllMessages(["allowed"]);
 
try {
  for await (const message of stream) {
    // Received a message
    console.log("New message:", message);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Log any stream errors
  console.error(error);
}
```

```js [Node]
// stream all messages from all conversations
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllMessages(["allowed"]);
 
// stream only group messages
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllGroupMessages(["allowed"]);
 
// stream only dm messages
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllDmMessages(["allowed"]);
 
try {
  for await (const message of stream) {
    // Received a message
  }
} catch (error) {
  // log any stream errors
  console.error(error);
}
```

```tsx [React Native]
await alix.conversations.streamAllMessages(
  async (message: DecodedMessage<any>) => {
    // Received a message
  },
  { consentState: ["allowed"] }
);
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
alix.conversations.streamAllMessages(type: /* OPTIONAL DMS, GROUPS, ALL */, consentState: listOf(ConsentState.ALLOWED)).collect {
  // Received a message
}
```

```swift [Swift]
for await message in try await alix.conversations.streamAllMessages(type: /* OPTIONAL .dms, .groups, .all */, consentState: [.allowed]) {
  // Received a message
}

## Handle unsupported content types

As more [custom](/inboxes/content-types/content-types#create-a-custom-content-type) and [standards-track](/inboxes/content-types/content-types#standards-track-content-types) content types are introduced into the XMTP ecosystem, your app may encounter content types it does not support. This situation, if not handled properly, could lead to app crashes.

Each message is accompanied by a `fallback` property, which offers a descriptive string representing the content type's expected value. It's important to note that fallbacks are immutable and are predefined in the content type specification. In instances where `fallback` is `undefined`, such as read receipts, it indicates that the content is not intended to be rendered. If you're venturing into creating custom content types, you're provided with the flexibility to specify a custom fallback string. For a deeper dive into this, see [Build custom content types](/inboxes/content-types/custom).

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
const codec = client.codecFor(content.contentType);
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback !== undefined) {
    return message.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```js [Node]
const codec = client.codecFor(content.contentType);
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback !== undefined) {
    return message.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```jsx [React Native]
//contentTypeID has the following structure `${contentType.authorityId}/${contentType.typeId}:${contentType.versionMajor}.${contentType.versionMinor}`;
const isRegistered = message.contentTypeID in client.codecRegistry;
if (!isRegistered) {
  // Not supported content type
  if (message?.fallback != null) {
    return message?.fallback;
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val codec = client.codecRegistry.find(options?.contentType)
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback != null) {
    return message.fallback
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```

```swift [Swift]
let codec = client.codecRegistry.find(for: contentType)
if (!codec) {
  /*Not supported content type*/
  if (message.fallback != null) {
    return message.fallback
  }
  // Handle other types like ReadReceipts which are not meant to be displayed
}
```
