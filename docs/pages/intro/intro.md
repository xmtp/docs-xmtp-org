# What is XMTP?

XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) is the largest and most secure decentralized messaging network

XMTP is open and permissionless, empowering any developer to build end-to-end encrypted 1:1, group, and agent messaging experiences, and more.

## Why should I build with XMTP?

Build with XMTP to:

- **Deliver secure and private messaging**

    Using the [Messaging Layer Security](/protocol/security) (MLS) standard, a ratified [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/) standard, XMTP provides end-to-end encrypted messaging with forward secrecy and post-compromise security.

- **Provide spam-free inboxes**

    In any open and permissionless messaging ecosystem, spam is an inevitable reality, and XMTP is no exception. However, with XMTP [user consent preferences](/inboxes/user-consent/user-consent), developers can give their users spam-free inboxes displaying conversations with chosen contacts only.

- **Build on native crypto rails**
    
    Build with XMTP to tap into the capabilities of crypto and web3. Support decentralized identities, crypto transactions, and more, directly in a messaging experience.

- **Empower users to own and control their communications**

    With apps built with XMTP, users own their conversations, data, and identity. Combined with the interoperability that comes with protocols, this means users can access their end-to-end encrypted communications using any app built with XMTP.
    
- **Create with confidence**

    Developers are free to create the messaging experiences their users want—on a censorship-resistant protocol architected to last forever. Because XMTP isn't a closed proprietary platform, developers can build confidently, knowing their access and functionality can't be revoked by a central authority.

## Try an app built with XMTP

One of the best ways to understand XMTP is to use an app built with XMTP.

- Try [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat/), an app made for devs to learn to build with XMTP—using an app built with XMTP.

- Try the [Convos](https://www.convos.org/open) messaging app. Convos is open source courtesy of [Ephemera](https://ephemerahq.com/), the company stewarding the development and adoption of XMTP.
