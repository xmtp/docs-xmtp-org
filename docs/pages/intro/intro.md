# Introduction to XMTP

XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) is an **open, permissionless, and decentralized protocol for secure and private messaging**.

- **Deliver secure and private messaging**

    Using the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) standard, a newly ratified IETF standard, XMTP provides end-to-end encrypted messaging with forward secrecy and post-compromise security.

- **Provide spam-free inboxes**

    In any open and permissionless messaging ecosystem, spam is an inevitable reality, and XMTP is no exception. However, with XMTP user consent preferences, developers can give their users inboxes that are spam-free spaces for chosen contacts only.

- **Build confidently**

    Developers are free to create the messaging experiences their users wantâ€”on a censorship-resistant protocol architected to last forever. Because XMTP isn't a closed proprietary platform, developers can build confidently, knowing their access and functionality can't be revoked by a central authority.

- **Empower users to own and control their communications**

    With apps built with XMTP, users own their conversations, data, and identity. Combined with the interoperability that comes with protocols, this means users can access their end-to-end encrypted communications using any app in the [vibrant XMTP ecosystem](https://xmtp.org/).
