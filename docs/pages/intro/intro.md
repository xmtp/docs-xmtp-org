# What is XMTP?

XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) is an open, permissionless, and decentralized protocol for secure and private messaging.

## Why should I build with XMTP?

Build with XMTP to:

- **Deliver secure and private messaging**

    Using the [Messaging Layer Security](/protocol/specs) (MLS) standard, a newly ratified IETF standard, XMTP provides end-to-end encrypted messaging with forward secrecy and post-compromise security.

- **Provide spam-free inboxes**

    In any open and permissionless messaging ecosystem, spam is an inevitable reality, and XMTP is no exception. However, with XMTP [user consent preferences](/inboxes/user-consent/user-consent), developers can give their users spam-free inboxes for chosen contacts only.

- **Build on native crypto rails**

    Tap into the native capabilities of web3, enabling seamless token payments, decentralized identities, and more, for a fully integrated crypto experience in your messaging app.
 
- **Empower users to own and control their communications**

    With apps built with XMTP, users own their conversations, data, and identity. Combined with the interoperability that comes with protocols, this means users can access their end-to-end encrypted communications using any app built with XMTP.
    
- **Create with confidence**

    Developers are free to create the messaging experiences their users wantâ€”on a censorship-resistant protocol architected to last forever. Because XMTP isn't a closed proprietary platform, developers can build confidently, knowing their access and functionality can't be revoked by a central authority.
