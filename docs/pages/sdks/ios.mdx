# Get started with the XMTP iOS SDK

Use the XMTP Swift SDK to build secure, private, and decentralized messaging into your iOS app.

The guide provides some quickstart code, as well as a map to building a [secure messaging app](/protocol/security) with XMTP, including support for:

- End-to-end encrypted direct message and group chat conversations
- Rich content types (attachments, reactions, replies, and more)
- Spam-free inboxes using user consent preferences

## Quickstart

```swift [Swift]
// 1. Create a signer
// This depends on your app's wallet implementation.
// For example, using a library to get a signer from a private key:
let signer = try PrivateKey.generate()

// 2. Create the XMTP client
import XMTP
let client = try await Client.create(account: signer, options: .init(api: .init(env: .dev)))

// 3. Start a new conversation and send a message
let conversation = try await client.conversations.newConversation(with: "0xPEER_ADDRESS")
try await conversation.send(text: "Hello, Swift!")
```
