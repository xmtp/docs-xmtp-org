# Get started with the XMTP React Native SDK

Use the XMTP React Native SDK to build secure, private, and decentralized messaging into your cross-platform mobile app.

The guide provides some quickstart code, as well as a map to building a [secure messaging app](/protocol/security) with XMTP, including support for:

- End-to-end encrypted direct message and group chat conversations
- Rich content types (attachments, reactions, replies, and more)
- Spam-free inboxes using user consent preferences

## Quickstart

```tsx [React Native]
// 1. Create a signer (example with ethers.js)
// You would typically integrate this with a wallet connection library.
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'
const signer = Wallet.createRandom()

// 2. Create the XMTP client
import { Client } from '@xmtp/react-native-sdk'

const client = await Client.create(signer, { env: 'dev' })

// 3. Start a new conversation and send a message
const conversation = await client.conversations.newConversation(
  '0xPEER_ADDRESS'
)
await conversation.send('Hello, world!')
```
