# Get started with the XMTP Browser SDK

Use the XMTP Browser SDK to build web-based apps, tools, and experiences with secure, private, and decentralized messaging.

The guide provides some quickstart code, as well as a map to building a [secure messaging app](/protocol/security) with XMTP, including support for:

- End-to-end encrypted direct message and group chat conversations
- Rich content types (attachments, reactions, replies, and more)
- Spam-free inboxes using user consent preferences

## Quickstart

```tsx [Browser]
// 1. Create a signer from a browser wallet
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
 
const signer = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum)
})

// 2. Create the XMTP client
import { Client } from '@xmtp/browser-sdk'
 
const client = await Client.create(signer, { env: 'dev' })

// 3. Start a new conversation and send a message
const conversation = await client.conversations.newConversation(
  '0xPEER_ADDRESS'
)
await conversation.send('Hello, world!')
```
