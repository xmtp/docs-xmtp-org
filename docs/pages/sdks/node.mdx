# Get started with the XMTP Node SDK

Use the XMTP Node SDK to build server-side applications that interact with the XMTP network.

:::tip[ðŸ¤– Building an agent?]

For building AI agents, bots, or other automated services, use the [Build an agent with XMTP](/agents/build-an-agent) tutorial tailored to this use case.

:::

For all other server-side applications, including backends for chat inboxes, follow the get started guide below, which provides some quickstart code, as well as a map to building a [secure messaging app](/protocol/security) with XMTP, including support for:

- End-to-end encrypted direct message and group chat conversations
- Rich content types (attachments, reactions, replies, and more)
- Spam-free inboxes using user consent preferences

## Quickstart

```tsx [Node]
// 1. Create a signer
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'
const signer = Wallet.createRandom()

// 2. Create the XMTP client
import { Client } from '@xmtp/node-sdk'
import { randomBytes } from 'crypto'

// You'll want to store the key somewhere in your app's backend
// to avoid creating a new key on every app start.
const newEncryptionKey = randomBytes(32)

const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: 'dev',
  encryptionKey: newEncryptionKey,
})

// 3. Start a new conversation and send a message
const conversation = await xmtp.conversations.newConversation(
  '0xPEER_ADDRESS'
)
await conversation.send('Hello from Node!')
```
