# Launch checklist

To be featured on the [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org/) home page and receive amplification from XMTP's social channels, follow this checklist. Meeting these criteria helps you provide a best-in-class messaging experience with your client.

## A. Follow this quality checklist

Before launching, ensure your app meets the following criteria:

### Meet performance benchmarks

- [ ] Implement a [Local-first cache](/perf-ux/local-first).
- [ ] Cache conversation list `conversations.list()` to boost performance by 90%.
- [ ] Serialize securely stored `DecodedMessage` histories to reduce redundant downloads and decryptions.
- [ ] Implement message [pagination](/dms/messages#list-messages-in-a-conversation-with-pagination).
- [ ] Compress message content with a suitable compression algorithm.
- [ ] Follow the [testing tutorial](/perf-ux/debug-and-test)
- [ ] (Bonus) Implement [optimistic sending](/perf-ux/optimistic-sending).

### Meet reliability benchmarks

- [ ] No duplicate conversations should be created or displayed. If duplicates exist, only the latest conversation should be visible.
- [ ] The app should be stable and not crash frequently.
- [ ] No visible critical bugs.
- [ ] Make sure to use the latest [XMTP client SDK](/get-started/examples).
- [ ] Always set an `appVersion` [value](/client/create-client#configure-the-client).

### Support content types

- [ ] Support image [remote attachments](/content-types/remote-attachment).
- [ ] Support [message replies](/content-types/reply)
- [ ] Support [message reactions](/content-types/reaction)
- [ ] (Bonus) Support [onchain transaction references](/content-types/transaction-ref)

### Support identity resolution

- [ ] Offer forward and reverse [identity resolution](/perf-ux/identity-resolution) support for ENS.
- [ ] (Bonus) Support for UNS, cb.id, .lens, Cyberconnect.

### Track basic and privacy-preserving metrics

Enable your app to keep track of:

- [ ] Number of active wallets: At least one message sent.
- [ ] Number of active conversations: At least one message.
- [ ] Number of returning conversations: A minimum of one message from each participant.
