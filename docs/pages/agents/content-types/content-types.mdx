# Understand content types with XMTP

When you build an agent with XMTP, all messages are encoded with a content type to ensure that an XMTP client knows how to encode and decode messages, ensuring interoperability and consistent display of messages across apps.

In addition, message payloads are transported as a set of bytes. This means that payloads can carry any content type that a client supports, such as plain text, JSON, or even non-text binary or media content.

## Standard content types

### Text content type

An agent built with XMTP uses the `TextCodec` (plain text) standard content type by default. This means that if your agent is sending plain text messages only, you don't need to perform any additional steps related to content types.

```jsx [Node]
await ctx.conversation.send("gm");
```

## Receiving content types

When your agent receives messages with different content types, you can use the `types` hook to handle them appropriately:

```jsx [Node]
// Listen for specific content types
agent.on("attachment", async (ctx) => {
  console.log("Received attachment:", ctx.message.content);
  // Handle attachment logic
});

agent.on("reaction", async (ctx) => {
  console.log("Received reaction:", ctx.message.content);
  // Handle reaction logic
});

agent.on("reply", async (ctx) => {
  console.log("Received reply:", ctx.message.content);
  // Handle reply logic
});

agent.on("transaction", async (ctx) => {
  console.log("Received transaction:", ctx.message.content);
  // Handle transaction logic
});

// For custom content types, you can access the content type directly
agent.on("message", async (ctx) => {
  const contentType = ctx.message.contentType;
  if (contentType?.typeId === "my-custom-type") {
    console.log("Received custom content:", ctx.message.content);
  }
});
```

## Additional content types

These content types are available for use in your agents:

- [Remote attachment content type](/agents/content-types/attachments): Use to send attachments of any size.
- [Reaction content type](/agents/content-types/reactions): Use a reaction to send a quick and often emoji-based way to respond to a message.
- [Reply content type](/agents/content-types/replies): Use a reply to send a direct response to a specific message in a conversation. Users can select and reply to a particular message instead of sending a new one.
- [Transactions content type](/agents/content-types/transactions): Use to send transaction requests to wallets and share references to completed onchain transactions.
- [Markdown content type](/agents/content-types/markdown): Use to send rich text messages with formatting, links, and structured content.
- [Inline actions content type](/agents/content-types/inline-actions): Use to send interactive button-based UI following the XIP-67 specification.
