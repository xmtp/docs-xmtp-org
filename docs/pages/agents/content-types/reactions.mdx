# Support reactions with your agent built with XMTP

Use the reaction content type to support reactions with your agent. A reaction is a quick and often emoji-based way to respond to a message. Reactions are usually limited to a predefined set of emojis or symbols provided by the chat app.

To learn more, see the [Reaction example](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/tree/main/examples/xmtp-thinking-reaction) in the xmtp-agents-examples repo.

## Install the package

In some SDKs, the `ReactionCodec` is already included in the SDK. If not, you can install the package using the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

:::

## Configure the content type

After importing the package, you can register the codec.

```jsx [Node]
import { ReactionCodec } from '@xmtp/content-type-reaction';
// Create the XMTP agent
const agent = await Agent.create(signer, {
  env: 'dev',
  codecs: [new ReactionCodec()],
});
```

## Send a reaction

With XMTP, reactions are represented as objects with the following keys:

- `reference`: ID of the message being reacted to

- `action`: Action of the reaction (added or removed)

- `content`: String representation of the reaction (smile, for example) to be interpreted by clients

- `schema`: Schema of the reaction (Unicode, shortcode, or custom)

```tsx [Node]
await ctx.sendReaction('❤️');
```

## Receive a reaction

```tsx [Node]
agent.on('reaction', async (ctx) => {
  const message = ctx.message;
  const reactionContent = message.content;
  console.log(`New reaction: ${reactionContent.content}`);
});
```

## Filter a reaction

Now that you can send a reaction, you need a way to receive a reaction. For example:

```tsx [Node]
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReaction)) {
  // We've got a reaction.
  const reaction: Reaction = message.content;
}
```
