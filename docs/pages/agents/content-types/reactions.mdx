# Support reactions in your app built with XMTP

Use the reaction content type to support reactions in your app. A reaction is a quick and often emoji-based way to respond to a message. Reactions are usually limited to a predefined set of emojis or symbols provided by the messaging app.

## Use a local database for performance

Use a local database to store reactions. This enables your app to performantly display a reaction with its [referenced message](#send-a-reaction) when rendering message lists.

### Install the package

In some SDKs, the `ReactionCodec` is already included in the SDK. If not, you can install the package using the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

:::

## Configure the content type

After importing the package, you can register the codec.

```jsx [Node]
import {
  ReactionCodec,
} from "@xmtp/content-type-reaction";
// Create the XMTP client
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: "dev",
  codecs: [new ReactionCodec()],
});
```

## Send a reaction

With XMTP, reactions are represented as objects with the following keys:

- `reference`: ID of the message being reacted to

- `action`: Action of the reaction (added or removed)

- `content`: String representation of the reaction (smile, for example) to be interpreted by clients

- `schema`: Schema of the reaction (Unicode, shortcode, or custom)

```tsx [Node]
const reaction = {
  reference: someMessageID,
  action: "added",
  content: "smile",
};

await conversation.send(reaction, {
  contentType: ContentTypeReaction,
});
```

## Receive a reaction

Now that you can send a reaction, you need a way to receive a reaction. For example:

```tsx [Node]
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReaction)) {
  // We've got a reaction.
  const reaction: Reaction = message.content;
}
```

To handle unsupported content types, refer to the [fallback](/inboxes/content-types/fallback) section.

## Display the reaction

Generally, reactions should be interpreted as emoji. So, "smile" would translate to ðŸ˜„ in UI clients. That being said, how you ultimately choose to render a reaction in your app is up to you.

## Notifications and reactions

Reactions have `shouldPush` set to `false`, which means that reactions do not trigger push notifications as long as the notification server respects this flag.
