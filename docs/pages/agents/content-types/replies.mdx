# Support replies with your agent built with XMTP

Use the reply content type to support quote replies with your agent. A reply is a method to directly respond to a specific message in a conversation. Users can select and reply to a particular message instead of sending a new one.

## Use a local database for performance

Use a local database to store replies. This will enable your app to performantly display a reply with its [referenced message](#send-a-reply) when rendering message lists.

### Install the package

In some SDKs, the `ReplyCodec` is already included in the SDK. If not, you can install the package using the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @xmtp/content-type-reply
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @xmtp/content-type-reply
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @xmtp/content-type-reply
```

:::

## Configure the content type

After importing the package, you can register the codec.

```js [Node]
import { ReplyCodec } from '@xmtp/content-type-reply';
// Create the XMTP client
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: 'dev',
  codecs: [new ReplyCodec()],
});
```

## Send a reply

Once you've created a reply, you can send it. Replies are represented as objects with two keys:

- `reference`: ID of the message being replied to

- `content`: String representation of the reply

```ts [Node]
import { ContentTypeText } from '@xmtp/content-type-text';
import { ContentTypeReply } from '@xmtp/content-type-reply';
import type { Reply } from '@xmtp/content-type-reply';

const reply: Reply = {
  reference: someMessageID,
  contentType: ContentTypeText,
  content: 'I concur',
};

await conversation.send(reply, {
  contentType: ContentTypeReply,
});
```

## Receive the content type

```ts [Node]
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReply)) {
  // We've got a reply.
  const reply: Reply = message.content;
}
```
