# Support attachments in your app built with XMTP

Use the remote attachment, multiple remote attachments, or attachment content type to support attachments in your app.

- Use the [remote attachment content type](#support-remote-attachments-of-any-size) to send one remote attachment of any size.

- Use the [multiple remote attachments content type](#support-multiple-remote-attachments-of-any-size-in-a-message) to send multiple remote attachments of any size.

- Use the [attachment content type](#support-attachments-smaller-than-1mb) to send attachments smaller than 1MB.

## Support remote attachments of any size

One remote attachment of any size can be sent in a message using the `RemoteAttachmentCodec` and a storage provider.

To send multiple remote attachments of any size in a single message, see [Support multiple remote attachments of any size in a message](#support-multiple-remote-attachments-of-any-size-in-a-message).

### Install the package

In some SDKs, the `AttachmentCodec` is already included in the SDK. If not, you can install the package using the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment
```

:::

### Configure the content type

After importing the package, you can register the codec.

```jsx [Node]
import {
  AttachmentCodec,
  RemoteAttachmentCodec,
} from "@xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment";
// Create the XMTP client
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: "dev",
  codecs: [new AttachmentCodec(), new RemoteAttachmentCodec()],
});
```

### Send a remote attachment

Load the file. This example uses a web browser to load the file:

```jsx [Node]
//image is the uploaded event.target.files[0];
const data = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = () => {
    if (reader.result instanceof ArrayBuffer) {
      resolve(reader.result);
    } else {
      reject(new Error("Not an ArrayBuffer"));
    }
  };
  reader.readAsArrayBuffer(image);
});
```

Create an attachment object:

```tsx [Node]
// Local file details
const attachment = {
  filename: image?.name,
  mimeType: image?.type,
  data: new Uint8Array(data),
};
```

Use `RemoteAttachmentCodec.encodeEncrypted` to encrypt an attachment:

```tsx [Node]
const encryptedEncoded = await RemoteAttachmentCodec.encodeEncrypted(
  attachment,
  new AttachmentCodec()
);
```

Upload an encrypted attachment to a location where it will be accessible via an HTTPS GET request. This location will depend on which storage provider you use based on your needs.

Now that you have a `url`, you can create a `RemoteAttachment`:

```jsx [Node]
const remoteAttachment = {
  url: url,
  contentDigest: encryptedEncoded.digest,
  salt: encryptedEncoded.salt,
  nonce: encryptedEncoded.nonce,
  secret: encryptedEncoded.secret,
  scheme: "https://",
  filename: attachment.filename,
  contentLength: attachment.data.byteLength,
};
```

Now that you have a remote attachment, you can send it:

```jsx [Node]
await conversation.send(remoteAttachment, {
  contentType: ContentTypeRemoteAttachment,
});
```

### Receive, decode, and decrypt a remote attachment

Now that you can send a remote attachment, you need a way to receive it. For example:

```tsx [Node]
import { ContentTypeRemoteAttachment } from "@xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment";

if (message.contentType.sameAs(RemoteAttachmentContentType)) {
  const attachment = await RemoteAttachmentCodec.load(message.content, client);
}
```

You now have the original attachment:

```bash [Bash]
attachment.filename // => "screenshot.png"
attachment.mimeType // => "image/png",
attachment.data // => [the PNG data]
```

Once you've created the attachment object, you can create a preview to show in the message input field before sending:

```tsx [Node]
const objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(
  new Blob([Buffer.from(attachment.data)], {
    type: attachment.mimeType,
  })
);

const img = document.createElement("img");
img.src = objectURL;
img.title = attachment.filename;
```

To handle unsupported content types, refer to the [fallback](#TODO) section.

## Support attachments smaller than 1MB

Attachments smaller than 1MB can be sent using the `AttachmentCodec`. The codec will automatically encrypt the attachment and upload it to the XMTP network.

:::warning

Unless a very specific use case we recommend using the [remote attachment content type](/inboxes/content-types/attachments) instead since many attachments are larger than 1MB in a messaging app.

### Install the package

In some SDKs, the `AttachmentCodec` is already included in the SDK. If not, you can install the package using the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment
```
:::

### Import and register

```jsx [Node]
import {
  AttachmentCodec,
} from "@xmtp/content-type-remote-attachment";
// Create the XMTP client
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: "dev",
  codecs: [new AttachmentCodec()],
});
```

### Load local file

```tsx [Node]
// Read local file and extract its details
const file = fs.readFileSync("xmtp.png");
const filename = path.basename("xmtp.png");
const extname = path.extname("xmtp.png");
console.log(`Filename: ${filename}`);
console.log(`File Type: ${extname}`);
```

### Send encrypted file

```tsx [Node]
// Convert the file to a Uint8Array
const blob = new Blob([file], { type: extname });
let imgArray = new Uint8Array(await blob.arrayBuffer());

const attachment = {
  filename: filename,
  mimeType: extname, //image, video or audio
  data: imgArray,
};

console.log("Attachment created", attachment);
await conversation.send(attachment, { contentType: ContentTypeAttachment });
```

### Receive encrypted file

```jsx [Node]
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeAttachment)) {
  const blobdecoded = new Blob([message.content.data], {
    type: message.content.mimeType,
  });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blobdecoded);
}
```
