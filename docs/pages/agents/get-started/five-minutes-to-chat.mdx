# 5 minutes to chat

The fastest way to get an XMTP agent running. This wizard generates a self-contained script with ephemeral keys — just copy, paste, and run.

:::warning

This script uses `dbPath: null` for in-memory storage. Messages and identity are **not persisted** — every restart creates a new agent. For production agents, see the full [Quickstart](/agents/get-started/build-an-agent).

:::

## Prerequisites

Install a [Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/) and set up a project:

```bash
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
npm init -y
npm i @xmtp/agent-sdk tsx
```

## Generate your agent script

Save the generated code below as `agent.ts` in your project. Click **Regenerate** for fresh keys or switch the **Network** to target a different XMTP environment.

<AgentCodeWizard />

## Run

```bash
npx tsx agent.ts
```

## Talk to your agent

Open [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat), start a new conversation with your agent's address (printed in the console), and send a message. You should see a reply instantly.
