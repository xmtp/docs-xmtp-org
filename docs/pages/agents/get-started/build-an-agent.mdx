# Tutorial: Build an agent that uses XMTP

This tutorial provides a map to building agents with the [XMTP Node SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/tree/main/sdks/node-sdk). These agents can communicate with humans and other agents in chats built with XMTP.

Building with XMTP gives your agent access to:

- The [most secure](/protocol/security), [decentralized](/network/network-nodes) messaging network
- The building blocks of AI + money + secure chat
- Users on apps built with XMTP, including Coinbase Wallet, Convos, and more

### Agent examples

From a simple agent that replies "GM" to one that supports onchain transactions, explore and run a dozen [xmtp-agent-examples](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples) built with the [XMTP Node SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/tree/main/sdks/node-sdk).

### Cursor rules

You can use these [Cursor rules](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/blob/main/.cursor/README.md) to code agents with AI following XMTP development best practices.

## Build an agent

### Listen for and send messages

These are the steps to initialize the XMTP listener and send messages.

```tsx [Node]
// import the xmtp sdk
import { Client, type XmtpEnv, type Signer } from "@xmtp/node-sdk";

// encryption key, must be consistent across runs
const encryptionKey: Uint8Array = ...;
const signer: Signer = ...;
const env: XmtpEnv = "dev";

// create the client
const client = await Client.create(signer, {
  encryptionKey,
  env,
  appVersion: 'alix-agent/2.x'
});

// sync the client to get the latest messages
await client.conversations.sync();

// listen to all messages
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllMessages();
for await (const message of stream) {
  // ignore messages from the agent
  if (message?.senderInboxId === client.inboxId) continue;
  // get the conversation by id
  const conversation = await client.conversations.getConversationById(message.conversationId);
  // send a message from the agent
  await conversation.send("gm");
}
```

### Get the address of a user

Each user has a unique `inboxId` used to retrieve their associated addresses (identities). One `inboxId` can have multiple identities, such as EOAs and SCWs.

:::tip

An `inboxId` differs from an address. An `inboxId` is a user identifier, while an address identifies a user's wallet. Not all users have associated addresses. To learn more, see [Manage agent installations](/agents/core-messaging/agent-installations).

:::

```tsx [Node]
const inboxState = await client.preferences.inboxStateFromInboxIds([
  message.senderInboxId,
]);
const addressFromInboxId = inboxState[0].identifiers[0].identifier;
```

### Support onchain transactions and transaction references

To learn more, see the example [xmtp-transactions](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/tree/main/examples/xmtp-transactions) agent, as well as the [Support onchain transactions](/agents/content-types/transactions) and [Support onchain transaction references](/agents/content-types/transaction-refs) (receipts) documentation.

### Support attachments

To learn more, see the example [xmtp-attachments](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/tree/main/examples/xmtp-attachments) agent and [Support attachments](/agents/content-types/attachments) documentation.

### Support replies

To learn more, see [Support replies](/agents/content-types/replies) documentation.

### Support reactions

To learn more, see [Support reactions](/agents/content-types/reactions) documentation.

### Observe rate limits

XMTP enforces separate rate limits for read and write operations per client.

To learn more, see [Observe rate limits](/agents/core-messaging/rate-limits)

### Follow security best practices
