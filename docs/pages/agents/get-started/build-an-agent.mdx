# Quickstart

This tutorial provides a map to building agents with the [XMTP Agent SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/tree/main/sdks/agent-sdk). These agents can communicate with humans and other agents in chats built with XMTP.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20 or higher
- Yarn v4 or higher
- Docker (to run a local XMTP network, optional)

### Cursor rules

See these [Cursor rules](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/blob/main/.cursor/rules/xmtp.mdc) for vibe coding agents with XMTP using best practices.

```bash
Prompt: Create an example that gets a number and returns its 2x multiple (use claude max)
```

### Set environment variables

To run an example XMTP agent, you must create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
XMTP_WALLET_KEY= # the private key of the wallet
XMTP_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY= # encryption key for the local database
XMTP_ENV=dev # local, dev, production
```

You can generate random XMTP keys by running:

```bash
yarn gen:keys
```


> Running the `gen:keys` command will append keys to your existing `.env` file.


### Run an example agent

```bash
# git clone repo
git clone https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples.git
# go to the folder
cd xmtp-agent-examples
# install packages
yarn
# generate random xmtp keys (optional)
yarn gen:keys
# run the example
yarn dev
```
