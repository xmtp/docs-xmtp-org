# Tutorial: Build an agent that uses XMTP

This tutorial provides a map to building agents with the [XMTP Agent SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/tree/main/sdks/agent-sdk). These agents can communicate with humans and other agents in chats built with XMTP.

Building with XMTP gives your agent access to:

- The [most secure](/protocol/security), [decentralized](/network/network-nodes) messaging network
- The building blocks of AI + money + secure chat
- Users on apps built with XMTP, including Coinbase Wallet, Convos, and more

### Agent examples

From a simple agent that replies "GM" to one that supports onchain transactions, explore and run a dozen [xmtp-agent-examples](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples) built with the [XMTP Agent SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/tree/main/sdks/agent-sdk).

### Cursor rules

You can use these [Cursor rules](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/blob/main/.cursor/README.md) to code agents with AI following XMTP development best practices.

## Build an agent

### Basic agent setup

```tsx [Node]
import { Agent, createSigner, createUser, getTestUrl } from "@xmtp/agent-sdk";

// Create signer (you can plug in your own wallet signer)
const signer = createSigner(createUser());

// Create agent
const agent = await Agent.create(signer, {
  env: "dev",
  appVersion: 'my-agent/1.0'
});

// Respond to messages
agent.on("text", async (ctx) => {
  const senderAddress = await ctx.getSenderAddress();
  await ctx.conversation.send("gm");
});

await agent.start();
```

### Support onchain transactions and transaction references

### Support attachments

To learn more, see the example [xmtp-attachments](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/tree/main/examples/xmtp-attachments) agent and [Support attachments](/agents/content-types/attachments) documentation.

### Support replies
