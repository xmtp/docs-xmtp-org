# Build XMTP Agents

XMTP agents are autonomous programs that can participate in secure, end-to-end encrypted conversations on the XMTP network. Build agents that interact with humans and other agents across any XMTP-powered app.

## Why build agents with XMTP?

- **AI + Money + Secure Chat**: The only platform combining conversational AI, onchain transactions, and end-to-end encryption
- **Instant Distribution**: Your agents can reach users on Coinbase Wallet, Convos, and other XMTP apps immediately
- **Web3 Native**: Built-in support for wallet interactions, transactions, and decentralized identity
