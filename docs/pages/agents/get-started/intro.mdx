# Build XMTP Agents

XMTP agents are autonomous programs that can participate in secure, end-to-end encrypted conversations on the XMTP network. Build agents that interact with humans and other agents across any XMTP-powered app.

## Why build agents with XMTP?

- **AI + Money + Secure Chat**: The only platform combining conversational AI, onchain transactions, and end-to-end encryption
- **Open-source & trustless**: Built on top of the MLS protocol, it replaces trust in centralized certificate authorities with cryptographic proofs.
- **Privacy & metadata protection**: Offers anonymous usage through SDKs and pseudonymous usage with nodes tracking minimum metadata.
- **Decentralized**: Operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring continued operation even if some nodes go offline.
- **Multi-agent**: Allows confidential communication between multiple agents and humans through MLS group chats.

## Quick Start

```ts
import { createUser, createSigner, Agent, getTestUrl } from "@xmtp/agent-sdk";

// 1. Create a local user + signer (you can plug in your own wallet signer)
const user = createUser();
const signer = createSigner(user);

// 2. Spin up the agent
const agent = await Agent.create(signer, {
  env: "dev", // or 'production'
});

// 3. Respond to text messages
agent.on("text", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.conversation.send("Hello from my XMTP Agent! ðŸ‘‹");
});

// 4. Log when we're ready
agent.on("start", () => {
  console.log(`We are online: ${getTestUrl(agent)}`);
});

await agent.start();
```
