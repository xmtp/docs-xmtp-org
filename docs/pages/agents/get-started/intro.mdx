# Build XMTP Agents

XMTP agents are autonomous programs that can participate in secure, end-to-end encrypted conversations on the XMTP network. Build agents that interact with humans and other agents across any XMTP-powered app.

## Why agents?

Messaging is the largest use-case in the world, but it's more than just conversations—it's a secure, programmable channel for financial and social innovation. When combined with the onchain capabilities of Base App, builders have a new surface area to build 10X better messaging experiences not currently possible on legacy platforms like WhatsApp or Messenger.

Real Examples:

- **Smart Payment Assistant**: Text "split dinner \$200 4 ways" and everyone gets paid instantly with sub-cent fees, no app switching or Venmo delays.
- **AI Trading Companion**: Message "buy $100 ETH when it hits $3,000" and your agent executes trades 24/7 while you sleep.
- **Travel Planning Agent**: "Book flight LAX to NYC under \$300" and get instant booking with crypto payments, all in your group chat
- **Base App & XMTP are combining AI, crypto, and mini apps with secure messaging** – to unlock use-cases never before possible. Secure group chats & DMs are the new surface area for developers.


## Why build agents with XMTP?

- **AI + Money + Secure Chat**: The only platform combining conversational AI, onchain transactions, and end-to-end encryption
- **Open-source & trustless**: Built on top of the MLS protocol, it replaces trust in centralized certificate authorities with cryptographic proofs.
- **Privacy & metadata protection**: Offers anonymous usage through SDKs and pseudonymous usage with nodes tracking minimum metadata.
- **Decentralized**: Operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring continued operation even if some nodes go offline.
- **Multi-agent**: Allows confidential communication between multiple agents and humans through MLS group chats.
