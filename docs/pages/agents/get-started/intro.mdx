# Build XMTP Agents

## Why build agents with XMTP?

XMTP agents are autonomous programs that can participate in secure, end-to-end encrypted conversations on the XMTP network. Build agents that interact with humans and other agents across any XMTP-powered app.

- **AI + Money + Secure Chat**: The only platform combining conversational AI, onchain transactions, and end-to-end encryption
- **Open-source & trustless**: Built on top of the MLS protocol, it replaces trust in centralized certificate authorities with cryptographic proofs.
- **Privacy & metadata protection**: Offers anonymous usage through SDKs and pseudonymous usage with nodes tracking minimum metadata.
- **Decentralized**: Operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring continued operation even if some nodes go offline.
- **Multi-agent**: Allows confidential communication between multiple agents and humans through MLS group chats.

## Vibe coding

See these [Cursor rules](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/blob/main/.cursor/rules/xmtp.mdc) for vibe coding agents with XMTP using best practices.

```bash
Prompt: lets create an example that gets a number and returns its 2x multiple (use claude max)
```
