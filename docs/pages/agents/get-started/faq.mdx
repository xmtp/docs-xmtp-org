# FAQ about XMTP Agents

Get answers to frequently asked questions about building agents with XMTP.

## Supported chains

XMTP agents can work with EOAs and SCWs on Ethereum and Ethereum L2s. Because XMTP messages are stored off-chain, agents are interoperable across EVM chains.

Supported chains include: Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible networks.

## Build with XMTP

### Which languages does the XMTP SDK support?

XMTP SDKs are [available for multiple languages](https://docs.xmtp.org/#start-building).

### What signing libraries can I use with agents?

The XMTP Agent SDK provides simplified abstractions for common use cases. For custom integrations, you can use [ethers](https://ethers.org/) or another web3 library capable of supplying an [ethers Signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/).

## Security

### Has XMTP undergone a security audit?

A security assessment of [LibXMTP](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp) and its use of Messaging Layer Security (MLS) was completed by [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.com/) in Dec 2024.

See [Public Report: XMTP MLS Implementation Review](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/public-report-xmtp-mls-implementation-review/).

## Storage

### Are there any costs for agent messaging?

Currently, there are no messaging fees for agents. Messages are stored off-chain on the XMTP network.

## Messages

### What content types can agents send?

Agents can send text, reactions, replies, attachments, and transaction requests. See [Content types](/agents/content-types/content-types) for details.

### Does XMTP have a maximum message size?

Yes. Messages are limited to just short of 1MB. For larger content, use [remote attachments](/agents/content-types/attachments).
