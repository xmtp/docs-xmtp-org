# Quickstart: Build an agent that uses XMTP

This quickstart provides a map to building agents that can communicate with humans and other agents in chats built with XMTP.

Building with XMTP gives your agent access to:
- The [most secure](/protocol/security), [decentralized](/network/network-nodes) messaging network
- The building blocks of AI + money + secure chat
- Users on apps built with XMTP, including Coinbase Wallet, Convos, and more

### Agent examples

From a simple agent that replies "GM" to one that supports onchain transactions, explore and run a dozen [xmtp-agent-examples](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples) built with the [XMTP Node SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/tree/main/sdks/node-sdk).

### Cursor rules

You can use these [Cursor rules](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/blob/main/.cursor/README.md) to code agents with AI following XMTP development best practices.

### llms-full.txt

To make it easier to use AI coding tools to build agents with XMTP, you can find an `llms-full.txt` file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-full.txt.

This `llms-full.txt` file includes all XMTP documentation in a single plain text file for easy parsing by AI.

## Build an agent

### Listen for and send messages

These are the steps to initialize the XMTP listener and send messages.

```tsx
// import the xmtp sdk
import { Client, type XmtpEnv, type Signer } from "@xmtp/node-sdk";

// encryption key, must be consistent across runs
const encryptionKey: Uint8Array = ...;
const signer: Signer = ...;
const env: XmtpEnv = "dev";

// create the client
const client = await Client.create(signer, { encryptionKey, env });
// sync the client to get the latest messages
await client.conversations.sync();

// listen to all messages
const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllMessages();
for await (const message of stream) {
  // ignore messages from the agent
  if (message?.senderInboxId === client.inboxId) continue;
  // get the conversation by id
  const conversation = await client.conversations.getConversationById(message.conversationId);
  // send a message from the agent
  await conversation.send("gm");
}
```

To learn more about:

- `Client.create`, see [Create an XMTP client](/inboxes/create-a-client).

- `conversations.sync`, see [Sync new conversations](/inboxes/sync-and-syncall#sync-new-conversations).

- `conversations.streamAllMessages`, see [Stream all group chat and DM messages and preferences](/inboxes/stream#stream-all-group-chat-and-dm-messages-and-preferences).

- `conversations.getConversationById`, see [Conversation helper methods](/inboxes/create-conversations#conversation-helper-methods).

- `conversation.send`, see [Send messages](/inboxes/send-messages).

### Get the address of a user

Each user has a unique `inboxId` used to retrieve their associated addresses (identities). One `inboxId` can have multiple identities, such as EOAs and SCWs.

:::tip

An `inboxId` differs from an address. An `inboxId` is a user identifier, while an address identifies a user's wallet. Not all users have associated addresses. To learn more, see [Manage XMTP inboxes and installations](/inboxes/manage-inboxes).

:::

```tsx
const inboxState = await client.preferences.inboxStateFromInboxIds([
  message.senderInboxId,
]);
const addressFromInboxId = inboxState[0].identifiers[0].identifier;
```

To learn more, see [View the inbox state](/inboxes/manage-inboxes#view-the-inbox-state).

### Support onchain transactions and transaction references

To learn more, see the example [xmtp-transactions](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/tree/main/examples/xmtp-transactions) agent, as well as the [Support onchain transactions](/inboxes/content-types/transactions) and [Support onchain transaction references](/inboxes/content-types/transaction-refs) (receipts) documentation.

### Support attachments

To learn more, see the example [xmtp-attachments](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples/tree/main/examples/xmtp-attachments) agent and [Support attachments](/inboxes/content-types/attachments) documentation. 

### Support replies

To learn more, see the example [good example for this?](#TODO) agent and [Support replies](/inboxes/content-types/replies) documentation. 

### Support reactions

To learn more, see the example [good example for this?](#TODO) agent and [Support reactions](/inboxes/content-types/reactions) documentation. 

### Observe rate limits

XMTP enforces a rate limit of 10,000 calls to the network per client per a rolling 5-minute window.

These network calls include actions like:

- Sending chat messages
- Adding and removing wallets
- Adding and revoking installations
- Adding and removing group members
- Updating group metadata

When you reach the rate limit, your API calls will be rejected with a 429 (Too Many Requests) error. 

### Handle stream failures

All streaming methods accept a callback as the last argument that will be called when the stream fails. Use this callback to restart the stream.

An example of how to use the callback to restart the stream:

```tsx
const MAX_RETRIES = 5;
// wait 5 seconds before each retry
const RETRY_INTERVAL = 5000;

let retries = MAX_RETRIES;

const retry = () => {
  console.log(
    `Retrying in ${RETRY_INTERVAL / 1000}s, ${retries} retries left`,
  );
  if (retries > 0) {
    retries--;
    setTimeout(() => {
      handleStream(client);
    }, RETRY_INTERVAL);
  } else {
    console.log("Max retries reached, ending process");
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

const onFail = () => {
  console.log("Stream failed");
  retry();
};

const handleStream = async (client) => {
  console.log("Syncing conversations...");
  await client.conversations.sync();

  const stream = await client.conversations.streamAllMessages(
    onMessage,
    undefined,
    undefined,
    onFail,
  );

  console.log("Waiting for messages...");

  for await (const message of stream) {
    // process streammessage
  }
};

await handleStream(client);
```

### Follow security best practices

For an agent to function—whether it's answering questions, executing commands, or providing automated responses—it must be able to read the conversation to understand what's being asked, and write messages to respond. 

Like any other user, this means your agent holds the cryptographic keys required to decrypt and send messages in the conversation. As an agent developer, it's important to uphold the security of these keys and messages.

Here are some security best practices:

- **Never expose private keys**: Use environment variables.
- **Keep messages secure and private**: Do not log messages in plaintext. Do not share messages with third parties.
- **Label agents clearly**: Clearly identify your agent as an agent and don't have an agent impersonate a human.

## Test and debug an agent

You can test and interact with your agent using [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat), the official web inbox for developers.

Be sure to point xmtp.chat to the XMTP environment set in your agent's `.env` file.

You can use this code to get your agent's client information, which provides useful values for testing and debugging: 

```tsx
const inboxState = await client.preferences.inboxState();
const address = inboxState.identifiers[0].identifier;
const inboxId = client.inboxId;
const installationId = client.installationId;
const conversations = await client.conversations.list();

console.log(`
XMTP Client:
  • InboxId: ${inboxId}
  • Address: ${address}
  • Conversations: ${conversations.length}
  • Installations: ${inboxState.installations.length}
  • InstallationId: ${installationId}
  • Network: ${process.env.XMTP_ENV}
`);
```

## Deploy an agent

This section covers how to deploy an agent using Railway—a platform many developers prefer for quickly and easily deploying agents. While this tutorial focuses on Railway, you can use any hosting provider that supports Node.js and environment variables.

Alternative platforms include:
- Heroku
- Fly.io
- Render
- Vercel

Want to contribute a deployment guide for another platform? We welcome [pull requests](https://github.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/blob/main/README.md)!

### 1. Create a Railway account

Sign up for an account at [Railway](https://railway.app/) if you don't already have one.

### 2. Start a new project

From your Railway dashboard, click **New Project** and select **Empty Project**.

![Railway New Project Screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42016550-0ab5-4c6b-a644-39d27746916f)

### 3. Import your agent's GitHub repository

Click **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select the repository that contains your agent code.

![Import GitHub Repository](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88305e11-0e8a-4a92-9bbf-d9fece23b42f)

### 4. Configure volume storage

Your XMTP agent will need persistent storage. Add a volume to your container:

1. Navigate to your service settings.
2. Select the **Volumes** tab.
3. Add a new volume and specify the mount path.

   ![Adding a Volume](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85c45d1b-ee5b-469a-9c57-6e4a71c8bb92)

Use this code in your agent to properly connect to the Railway volume:

```tsx
export const getDbPath = (env: string, suffix: string = "xmtp") => {
  //Checks if the environment is a Railway deployment
  const volumePath = process.env.RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH ?? ".data/xmtp";
  // Create database directory if it doesn't exist
  if (!fs.existsSync(volumePath)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(volumePath, { recursive: true });
  }
  const dbPath = `${volumePath}/${env}-${suffix}.db3`;

  return dbPath;
};
```

Then, specify `dbPath` in your client options:

```tsx
const receiverClient = await Client.create(signer, {
    dbEncryptionKey,
    env: XMTP_ENV as XmtpEnv,
    dbPath: getDbPath(XMTP_ENV),
  });
```

### 5. Configure environment variables

1. Get the connection string for your database.
   
   ![Get Redis Connection String](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fbebe34-e09f-4bf7-bc8b-b43cbc2b7762)

2. Add the connection string and any other required environment variables to your service.
   
   ![Environment Variables Editor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4393b179-227e-4c7c-8313-165f191356ff)

### 6. Deploy your agent

Once all configurations are set, Railway will automatically deploy your agent. You can monitor the deployment process on the **Deployments** tab.

### 7. Share your agent (optional)

Consider registering an [ENS domain](https://ens.domains/) for your agent to make it easy to share and access.

### Example Railway deployment

For reference, here's an example Railway deployment of a [gm-bot](https://railway.com/deploy/UCyz5b) agent.
