# Deploy an agent

This section covers how to deploy an agent using [Railway](https://railway.app/)—a platform many developers prefer for quickly and easily deploying agents. While this tutorial focuses on Railway, you can use any hosting provider that supports Node.js and environment variables.

Alternative platforms include (Ubuntu-based):

- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [Render](https://render.com/)

:::tip

The XMTP Agent SDK has been tested on Ubuntu distributions only. While other Debian-based distributions may work, compatibility is not guaranteed.

## 1. Create a Railway account

Sign up for an account at [Railway](https://railway.app/) if you don't already have one.

## 2. Start a new project

From your Railway dashboard, click **New Project** and select **Empty Project**.

## 3. Import your agent's GitHub repository

Click **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select the repository that contains your agent code.

## 4. Configure volume storage

Your XMTP agent will need persistent storage. Add a volume to your container:

![Add a Volume](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3687c991-b758-4d1c-bc08-3a1c6a20f116)

Add a new volume and specify the mount path.

![Set a Volume Path](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85c45d1b-ee5b-469a-9c57-6e4a71c8bb92)

Use this code in your agent to properly connect to the Railway volume:

```tsx [Node]
const customDbPath = (inboxId) =>
  `${process.env.RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH ?? '.'}/${process.env.XMTP_ENV}-${inboxId.slice(0, 8)}.db3`;

const agent = await Agent.createFromEnv({
  dbPath: customDbPath,
});
```

## 5. Deploy your agent

Once all configurations are set, Railway will automatically deploy your agent. You can monitor the deployment process on the **Deployments** tab.

## 6. Share your agent (optional)

Consider registering an [ENS domain](https://ens.domains/) for your agent to make it easy to share and access.

## Example Railway deployment

For reference, here's an example Railway deployment of a [gm-bot](https://railway.com/deploy/UCyz5b) agent.
