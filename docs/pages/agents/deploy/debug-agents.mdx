# Debug an agent

You can debug and interact with your agent using [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat), the official web chat app for developers.

Be sure to point xmtp.chat to the XMTP environment set in your agent's `.env` file.

## Run a local XMTP network

`dev` and `production` networks are hosted by XMTP, while you can run your own `local` network.

1. Install Docker

2. Start the XMTP service and database

   ```bash
   ./dev/up
   ```

3. Change the `.env` file to use the `local` network

   ```bash
   XMTP_ENV = local
   ```

4. Try out the example agents using [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat), the official web inbox for developers.

## Enable debug logging

To activate detailed debugging logs, set the `XMTP_FORCE_DEBUG` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
XMTP_FORCE_DEBUG=true
```

This will enable verbose logging throughout the XMTP Agent SDK, helping you troubleshoot issues and understand the internal flow of messages and events.

## Debug agent information

You can use this code to get your agent's client information, which provides useful values for debugging:

```tsx [Node]
// Log when we're ready
agent.on('start', (): void => {
  logDetails(agent.client);
});
```

Example output:

```bash
