# Debug an agent

You can debug and interact with your agent using [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat), the official web chat app for developers.

Be sure to point xmtp.chat to the XMTP environment set in your agent's `.env` file.

## Enable Debug Logging

To activate detailed debugging logs, set the `XMTP_FORCE_DEBUG` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
XMTP_FORCE_DEBUG=true
```

This will enable verbose logging throughout the XMTP Agent SDK, helping you troubleshoot issues and understand the internal flow of messages and events.

## Get Agent Information

You can use this code to get your agent's client information, which provides useful values for debugging:

```tsx [Node]
// With the agent-sdk, debugging is simplified
agent.on("start", () => {
  console.log(`✓ XMTP Agent:
  • Address: ${agent.client.accountIdentifier?.identifier}
  • InboxId: ${agent.client.inboxId}
  • InstallationId: ${agent.client.installationId}
  • Environment: ${agent.client.options?.env ?? "dev"}
  • Test URL: ${getTestUrl(agent)}
  • Ready to receive messages!`);
});
```
