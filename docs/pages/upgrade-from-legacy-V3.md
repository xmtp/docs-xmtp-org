# Upgrade from a legacy XMTP V3 SDK to a stable XMTP V3 SDK

This document is for you if you are upgrading from a legacy XMTP V3 SDK. Legacy XMTP V3 SDKs include:

- Browser SDK v0.x.x-&lt;v1.1.4
- Node SDK v0.x.x-&lt;v1.0.5
- React Native SDK v3.x.x-&lt;v4.0.2
- Android SDK v3.x.x-&lt;v4.0.3
- iOS SDK v3.x.x-&lt;v4.0.4

:::tip[Upgrading from a legacy XMTP V2 SDK?]

Legacy XMTP V2 SDKs include JavaScript SDK vx.x.x, React Native SDK &lt;v3, Android SDK &lt;v3, and iOS SDK &lt;v3. To learn how to upgrade to stable XMTP V3, see [Upgrade from a legacy XMTP V2 SDK](/upgrade-from-legacy-V2).

XMTP V3 provides support for the features expected by modern messaging apps while laying a strong foundation for the future. This is a stable and performant release that will allow for new features and is not expected to receive breaking changes in the near-term.

## Upgrade to XMTP V3 stable

The process to upgrade an app built with a legacy XMTP V3 SDK to a stable V3 SDK is designed to be straightforward, with most functions in stable V3 working as they did in legacy V3. However, there are some notable differences, which we cover here and in these release notes:

ðŸŸ¢ For mobile apps, **upgrade to an XMTP mobile SDK >=v4.0.4** following the detailed instructions in these release notes:
- [React Native](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-react-native/releases/tag/v4.0.2)
- [Kotlin](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-android/releases/tag/4.0.3)
- [Swift](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-ios/releases/tag/4.0.4)

ðŸŸ¢ For web apps, **upgrade to an XMTP web SDK >=v1.1.4** or **upgrade to an XMTP node SDK >=v1.0.5** following the detailed instructions in these release notes:
- [Browser](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/releases/tag/%40xmtp%2Fbrowser-sdk%401.1.4)
- [Node](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/releases/tag/%40xmtp%2Fnode-sdk%401.0.5)
- For additional guidance, try [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat/), an interactive developer tool and chat app built with XMTP V3.

ðŸŸ¢ For agents, **explore [example agents](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples)** built with the XMTP Node SDK >=v1.0.0.

## Primary XMTP identifier is now an inbox ID, not an Ethereum address

XMTP is evolving from using Ethereum account addresses (0x...) as the primary identifier to an inbox-based identity model. This change allows for broader support of different authentication mechanisms, including the currently supported [Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Smart Contract Wallets (SCWs)](/inboxes/create-a-signer), as well as future support for Passkeys and other identity types.

Instead of assuming an Ethereum address as the unique identifier, developers should default to using the `inboxId`, where possible. An `inboxId` has a list of identity objects that explicitly includes the identity type (kind) and identifier. Some identity types, like Passkeys, do not have an associated onchain address, so using the `inboxId` provides a consistent way to identify users across different authentication methods.

For example:

```json
[
  {
    "kind": "ETHEREUM",
    "identifier": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
  },
  {
    "kind": "PASSKEY", // not yet supported; provided as an example only.
    "identifier": "AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRobHB0eHyAhIiMk",
  }
]
```

This change ensures that XMTP identities are more extensible and adaptable, accommodating future improvements in authentication methods while maintaining backward compatibility for Ethereum-based accounts.

### Example: Supporting multiple identity types

With this new model, an app can now distinguish different identity types when creating a signer.

```tsx
function createSigner(account): Signer {
  return {
    getIdentity: async () => ({
      kind: account.isSCW ? "ETHEREUM" : "PASSKEY", // Passkeys are not yet supported; provided as an example only.
      identifier: account.address || account.passkeyId,
    }),
    signMessage: async (message) => {
      return account.signMessage(message);
    },
    getChainId: account.isSCW ? () => BigInt(8453) : undefined,
    getBlockNumber: account.isSCW ? () => undefined : undefined,
  };
}
```

### Before: Using getAddress()

Previously, developers used `getAddress()` to retrieve an accountâ€™s Ethereum address:

```tsx
const signer: Signer = {
  getAddress: () => "0x123...",
  signMessage: async (message) => {
    // return signed message
  },
};
```

While this approach worked for EOAs, it assumed that all accounts were Ethereum addresses and did not allow for other identity types.

### After: Using getIdentity()

Now, `getIdentity()` returns an identity object, allowing for multiple types of accounts:

```tsx
const signer: Signer = {
  getIdentity: () => ({
    kind: "ETHEREUM", // Identity type [ETHEREUM, PASSKEY (passkeys are not yet supported), etc.]
    identifier: "0x123...", // Account identifier
  }),
  signMessage: async (message) => {
    // return signed message
  },
};
```

### Before: newConveration()

Previously, developers used an Ethereum address to create a new DM conversation:

```tsx
const dm = await alix.conversations.findOrCreateDm(bo.address);
```

### After: newConveration()

Now, developers can use `inboxId` to create a new DM conversation because with the new flexible identity model, they cannot rely on the existence of an Ethereum address.

```tsx
const dm = await alix.conversations.findOrCreateDm(bo.inboxId);
```
