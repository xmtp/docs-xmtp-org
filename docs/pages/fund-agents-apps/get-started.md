# Get started with funding an app or agent to send messages with XMTP

Mainnet of the decentralized XMTP Network is expected to launch in early 2026.

Specifically, Mainnet launch will occur 60 days after the release of an SDK version that meets production standards for performance and reliability on Testnet.

With Mainnet launch, all message traffic will be automatically routed from the current production network to Mainnet. At this time, apps and agents will begin paying fees to send messages on Mainnet.
