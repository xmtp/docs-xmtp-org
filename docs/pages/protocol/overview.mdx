# XMTP protocol overview

XMTP is a decentralized messaging protocol that enables secure, end-to-end encrypted communication between blockchain addresses. This section covers the technical foundations and implementation details of how XMTP works under the hood.

## Architecture fundamentals

With XMTP, messages are routed through **[topics](/protocol/topics)**, which are unique addresses that identify conversation channels. Messages are packaged as **[envelope types](/protocol/envelope-types)** that contain the actual message data plus metadata for routing and processing.

The protocol prioritizes **security** through advanced cryptographic techniques, delivering end-to-end encryption for both 1:1 and group conversations. To learn more, see XMTP's [security properties](/protocol/security) and how [wallet signatures](/protocol/signatures) authenticate users.

## Group messaging mechanics

For group conversations, XMTP introduces sophisticated state management:

- **[Epochs](/protocol/epochs)** represent the cryptographic state of a group at any point in time. Each group operation (like adding members) creates a new epoch with fresh encryption keys. This concept comes from [Messaging Layer Security](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/), which XMTP builds upon.

- **[Intents](/protocol/intents)** provide reliable state management through an internal bookkeeping system that handles retries, crashes, and race conditions when applying group changes.

- **[Cursors](/protocol/cursors)** enable efficient message synchronization by tracking where each client left off when fetching new messages.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Purpose | Key benefit |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [Security](/protocol/security) | End-to-end encryption | Privacy and message integrity |
| [Topics](/protocol/topics) | Message routing and addressing | Efficient pub/sub architecture |
| [Envelope types](/protocol/envelope-types) | Message format and structure | Standardized communication protocol |
| [Epochs](/protocol/epochs) | Group cryptographic state | Key rotation and post-compromise security |
| [Intents](/protocol/intents) | Reliable group operations | Consistency despite network issues |
| [Cursors](/protocol/cursors) | Message synchronization | Efficient incremental updates |
| [Wallet signatures](/protocol/signatures) | Authentication | Verified sender identity |

## Protocol evolution

XMTP evolves through **[XMTP Improvement Proposals](/protocol/xips)** (XIPs), which are design documents that propose new features and improvements. This governance process ensures systematic and decentralized protocol development.
