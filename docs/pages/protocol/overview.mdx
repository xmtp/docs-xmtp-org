# XMTP protocol overview

XMTP is a decentralized messaging protocol that enables secure, end-to-end encrypted communication between any identities that can produce a verifiable cryptographic signature.

XMTP implements [Messaging Layer Security](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/) (MLS), which is designed to operate within the context of a messaging service. As the messaging service, XMTP needs to provide two services to facilitate messaging using MLS:

- An [authentication service](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-architecture/draft-ietf-mls-architecture.html#name-authentication-service)
- A [delivery service](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-architecture/draft-ietf-mls-architecture.html#name-delivery-service)

This section covers the elements of XMTP that provide these services.

:::info[Who should read these docs]

This protocol documentation is designed for:

- Protocol contributors working on XMTP's core implementation
- Security researchers auditing XMTP's cryptographic design
- Anyone curious about the technical details behind XMTP's messaging

For most developers, the [Build chat apps](/chat-apps/intro/get-started) and [Build agents](/agents/get-started/build-an-agent) sections provide the practical guidance needed to build with XMTP.

## Encryption

The encryption elements are mainly defined by MLS, with some additions by XMTP. To learn more, see:

- [Security](/protocol/security)

  XMTP and MLS prioritize security, privacy, and message integrity through advanced cryptographic techniques, delivering end-to-end
  encryption for both 1:1 and group conversations

- [Epochs](/protocol/epochs)

  Represent the cryptographic state of a group at any point in time. Each group operation (like adding members) creates a new epoch with fresh encryption keys

- [Envelope types](/protocol/envelope-types)

  Messages are packaged as envelope types that contain the actual message data plus metadata for routing and processing.

## Identity

The identity elements are mainly defined by XMTP. To learn more, see:

- [Inboxes, identities, and installations](/protocol/identity)

  The identity model includes an inbox ID and its associated identities and installations.

- [Wallet signatures](/protocol/signatures)

  Authenticate users using verifiable cryptographic signatures.

## Delivery

The delivery elements are mainly defined by XMTP. To learn more, see:

- [Topics](/protocol/topics)

  Messages are routed through topics, which are unique addresses that identify conversation channels.

- [Cursors](/protocol/cursors)

  Enable efficient message synchronization by tracking where each client left off when fetching new messages.

- [Intents](/protocol/intents)

  Provide reliable groupstate management through an internal bookkeeping system that handles retries, crashes, and race conditions when applying group changes.

## Protocol evolution

XMTP evolves through **[XMTP Improvement Proposals](/protocol/xips)** (XIPs), which are design documents that propose new features and improvements. This governance process ensures systematic and decentralized protocol development.
