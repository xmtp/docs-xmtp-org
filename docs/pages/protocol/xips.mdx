# XMTP Improvement Proposals (XIPs)

An XIP is a design document that proposes a new feature or improvement for XMTP or its processes or environment.

XIPs intend to be the primary mechanisms for:

- Proposing new features
- Collecting community technical input on an issue
- Documenting the design decisions that have gone into XMTP

For these reasons, XIPs are a great way to learn about XMTP's newest features and participate in shaping the evolution of the protocol.

To review the latest XIPs, see [Improvement Proposals](https://community.xmtp.org/c/xips/xip-drafts/53).

To learn more about XIPs and how to participate in the process, including authoring an XIP of your own, see [XIP purpose, process, and guidelines](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/XIPs/xip-0-purpose-process.md).
