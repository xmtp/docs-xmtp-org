# XMTP network

**A testnet of the decentralized XMTP network was launched in early December 2024.** ðŸŽ‰ To learn about testnet operation and how the XMTP network will be decentralized, see [The future of decentralization](https://xmtp.org/roadmap#the-decentralization-of-xmtp).

xmtpd (XMTP daemon) is the node software that powers the testnet and will power the mainnet of the decentralized XMTP network. To learn more, see the [xmtpd repo](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtpd).

xmtpd can be run on Helm and Terraform infrastructure. To learn more, see the [xmtpd-infrastructure repo](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtpd-infrastructure).

**All of the nodes in the `dev` and `production` XMTP network environments are still operated by [Ephemera](https://ephemerahq.com/)** (the company) and powered by [xmtp-node-go](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-node-go).

These nodes in the `dev` and `production` XMTP network environments operate in US jurisdiction in compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) export compliance regulations. Accordingly, IP-based geoblocking is in place for the following countries/territories:

- Cuba
- Iran
- North Korea 
- Syria
- The Crimea, Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic, and Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic regions of Ukraine

## FAQ

### Is XMTP a blockchain?

The `dev` and `production` XMTP network environments do not use a blockchain. Nodes in these networks run software to store and transfer messages between blockchain accounts. For secure and reliable delivery of messages, the nodes participate in a consensus mechanism.

To learn about how the plan to decentralize the XMTP network includes use of a blockchain, see [The future of decentralization](https://xmtp.org/roadmap#the-future-of-decentralization).

### Will I be able to run my own XMTP node?

At this time, not everyone will be able to run an XMTP node in the production decentralized XMTP network. 

To learn more, see [The future of decentralization](https://xmtp.org/roadmap#the-future-of-decentralization).

### Does XMTP have a token?

At this time there is no XMTP token and anyone who is trying to sell you one is trying to scam you.

If this changes, this FAQ will be updated with more details and an update will be shared from the [official XMTP X account](https://x.com/xmtp_). Do not trust any announcements from other channels.
