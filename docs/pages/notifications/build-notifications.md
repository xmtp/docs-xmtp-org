# Build push notifications for an app built with XMTP

The XMTP framework's notification architecture, in conjunction with Firebase Cloud Messaging, offers a secure and reliable approach to notification management and delivery. 

This guide describes the essential steps to build push notifications, from device registration to message decryption, along with a detailed explanation of each step and code examples.

To help illustrate a push notification scenario, consider a message Alix sends to Bo using a mobile messaging app. Al app is built with React Native for iOS devices and uses Firebase for notifications. 

## Notifications architectural overview

## Understand Apple entitlements for iOS apps

When building an iOS app with XMTP, you might want to suppress certain Apple push notifications. For example, you should suppress push notifications for a user's own messages.

You can use the [com.apple.developer.usernotifications.filtering](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_usernotifications_filtering) entitlement. To do so, you need to obtain permission from Apple. Submit the application using the app owner's Apple developer account via [https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/notification-service](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/notification-service).

:::tip[Submit your application early]
The approval process can take 2-3 weeks or longer.

Here are some sample answers to help you complete the application:

- **App name:** [Your app name]
- **App Store URL:** [Your app store URL]
- **Apple ID of App:** [Your app ID]
- **App Type:** Messaging
- **Does your app provide end-to-end encryption?:** Yes
- **Explain why existing APIs are not adequate for your app:** The existing APIs always show some sort of notification when a push comes in. We don't want to show a notification for a user's own messages.
- **Explain why your app doesnâ€™t show a visible notification each time a push notification is received:** The server delivering notifications only knows of the existence of a conversation. It does not know who the sender or recipient are. That data is decoded on the device in the extension. As a result, it sends a push notification for every message that occurs in the conversation. We want to filter out notifications for notifications that the user sent.
- **When your extension runs, what system and network resources does it need?:** We might need to make a GRPC request in order to load additional information about a conversation. This is only necessary when we haven't stored the conversation details locally, which is expected to be less common than being able to just decode the conversation locally.
- **How often does your extension run? What can trigger it to run?:** The extension will run whenever a message is sent or received in a conversation. The frequency will depend on how active a user is.

## 1. Initialize the XMTP client

Alix opens the frontend on their iOS device and initializes their new wallet with XMTP.

```javascript [JavaScript]
import { Client } from "@XMTP"; // XMTP JavaScript client

// Alix initializes their wallet on the Frontend
const XMTPClient = await Client.create(aliceSigner, { env: "dev" });
```

## 2. Register the device with Firebase

When Alix launches the frontend on their device for the first time, the app registers with Firebase to receive notifications.

```javascript [JavaScript]
// Get token from Firebase
const deviceToken = await messaging().getToken();
// Get unique ID for the device
const installationId = await installations().getId();
// Assume this function sets up your notification client
const client = createNotificationClient();

await client.registerInstallation({
  installationId,
  deliveryMechanism: {
    deliveryMechanismType: {
      value: deviceToken,
      case: "FirebaseDeviceToken",
    },
  },
});
```

## 3. Subscribe to topics

The notification server adds Alix's `installationId` to certain topics. The list of `subscriptionDetails` includes all information needed to join topics, such as user permission and HMAC keys for safely checking messages.

- `consentState`: Notifications are only subscribed to if the `consentState` of a conversation is "allowed". This ensures that users receive notifications only for conversations they have consented to. [Learn more](/consent/user-consent)

- `Invite` topic V2: Clients use invite topics to initiate conversations between wallets. [Learn more](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md#invitations)

- `Intro` topic V1: Clients use intro topics to store the first message sent between two wallets

```javascript [JavaScript]
let subscriptionDetails = [];

// Filter conversations to only include those with user consent, to respect privacy and avoid SPAM.
const consentedConversations = conversations.filter(
  (conversation) => conversation.consentState === "allowed",
);

// Compile the subscription info, attaching the HMAC key when available.
consentedConversations.forEach((conversation) => {
  subscriptionDetails.push({
    topic: conversation.topic,
    hmacKey: conversation.hmacKey || null,
  });
});

// Special topics without HMAC keys
subscriptionDetails.push({
  topic: buildUserInviteTopic(userAddress),
  hmacKey: null,
});
subscriptionDetails.push({
  topic: buildUserIntroTopic(userAddress),
  hmacKey: null,
});

// This operation sends the subscription details to the notification service.
await notificationClient.subscribeWithMetadata({
  installationId,
  subscriptions: subscriptionDetails,
});
```

## 4. Listen for notifications

Alix's frontend is now listening for incoming notifications.

```javascript [JavaScript]
// Listener for incoming Firebase notifications
messaging().onMessage(async (remoteMessage) => {
  console.log("A new message arrived!", remoteMessage);
});
```

## 5. Send a message

Bo sends a message to Alix using their instance of the frontend.

```javascript [JavaScript]
const bobClient = await Client.create(bobSigner, { env: "dev" });
const conversation = await bobClient.conversations.newConversation(aliceWallet);
await conversation.send("Hello Alix!");
```

## 6. XMTP network dispatch

The XMTP network sends the encrypted message and topic to the notification server.

```javascript [JavaScript]
// Pseudo-code for XMTP network sending encrypted message
const messageTopic = "XMTP/0/dm-alice-XMTP-topic-id";
sendToNotificationServer(encryptedMessage, messageTopic);
```

## 7. Trigger push notifications

The notification server triggers a push notification to Firebase.

```javascript [JavaScript]
const message = {
  data: {
    topic: messageTopic,
    message: encryptedMessage,
  },
  topic: messageTopic,
};
firebase_admin.messaging().send(message);
```

## 8. Firebase notification forwarding

Firebase forwards the notification to Alix's device.

## 9. Decrypt the message

Alix's frontend receives the notification and decrypts the message.

```javascript [JavaScript]
// Decrypting the message when a notification is received from Firebase
Firebase.messaging().onMessage((payload) => {
  const decryptedMessage = decryptMessage(payload.data.message, encryptionKey);
  console.log("Decrypted message:", decryptedMessage);
});
```
