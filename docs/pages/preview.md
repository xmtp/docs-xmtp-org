# Preview the latest XMTP V3 documentation

Weâ€™re excited to share a [preview of the latest XMTP V3 documentation](https://docs-xmtp-org-git-v3-preview-ephemerahq.vercel.app/). 

Soon, these preview docs will replace the content on this site, becoming the new standard reference. Until then, we strongly recommend using the preview docs to start building with XMTP V3 today.

The XMTP V3 SDKs will continue to evolve as we add features, rename functions, and iterate based on community feedback.

Onward builders! ðŸ«¡
