# Preview the latest XMTP V3 documentation

Weâ€™re excited to share a [preview](https://docs-xmtp-org-git-v3-preview-ephemerahq.vercel.app/) of the latest XMTP V3 documentation. Soon, these preview docs will replace the content on this site, becoming the new standard reference.

Until then, we strongly recommend using the [preview docs](https://docs-xmtp-org-git-v3-preview-ephemerahq.vercel.app/) to start building with XMTP V3 today.

The XMTP V3 SDKs will continue to evolve as we add features, rename functions, and iterate based on community feedback.

Onward builders! ðŸ«¡
