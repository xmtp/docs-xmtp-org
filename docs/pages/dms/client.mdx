# Create and configure an XMTP client

The XMTP message API revolves around a network client that allows retrieving and sending messages to other network participants. A client must be connected to a wallet on startup. The client will request a wallet signature in two cases:

1. To sign the newly generated key bundle. This happens only the very first time when key bundle is not found in storage.
2. To sign a random salt used to encrypt the key bundle in storage. This happens every time the client is started (including the very first time).

## Create a client

A client is created that requires passing in a connected wallet that implements the Signer interface.

[Use client configuration options](#configure-the-client) to change parameters of a client's network connection.

:::code-group

```ts [JavaScript]
import { Client } from "@xmtp/xmtp-js";
// Create the client with a `Signer` from your application
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, { env: "dev" });
```

<div data-title="React">
To use the hooks provided by the React SDK, you must wrap your app with an `XMTPProvider`. This gives the hooks access to the XMTP client instance.

```ts [TypeScript]
import { XMTPProvider } from "@xmtp/react-sdk";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <XMTPProvider>
      <App />
    </XMTPProvider>
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

```tsx [TypeScript]
export const CreateClient: React.FC<{ signer: Signer }> = ({ signer }) => {
  const { client, error, isLoading, initialize } = useClient();

  const handleConnect = useCallback(async () => {
    const options = {
      persistConversations: false,
      env: "dev",
    };
    await initialize({ keys, options, signer });
  }, [initialize]);

  if (error) {
    return "An error occurred while initializing the client";
  }

  if (isLoading) {
    return "Awaiting signatures...";
  }

  if (!client) {
    return (
      <button type="button" onClick={handleConnect}>
        Connect to XMTP
      </button>
    );
  }

  return "Connected to XMTP";
};
```
</div>

```kotlin [Kotlin]
// Create the client with a `SigningKey` from your app
val options =
    ClientOptions(
        api = ClientOptions.Api(env = XMTPEnvironment.PRODUCTION, isSecure = true)
    )
val client = Client().create(account = account, options = options)
```

```swift [Swift]
import XMTP

// Create the client with a `SigningKey` from your app
let client = try await Client.create(
  account: account, options: .init(api: .init(env: .production)))
```

```tsx [React Native]
import { Client } from "@xmtp/xmtp-react-native";
// Create the client with a `Signer` from your application
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer);
```
:::

## Saving keys

You can export the unencrypted key bundle using the static method `getKeys`, save it somewhere secure, and then provide those keys at a later time to initialize a new client using the exported XMTP identity.

:::code-group

<div data-title="JavaScript">
```jsx [JavaScript]
// Get the keys using a valid Signer. Save them somewhere secure.
import { loadKeys, storeKeys } from "./helpers";
const clientOptions = {
  env: "production",
};

let keys = loadKeys(address);
if (!keys) {
  keys = await Client.getKeys(signer, {
    ...clientOptions,
    // we don't need to publish the contact here since it
    // will happen when we create the client later
    skipContactPublishing: true,
    // we can skip persistence on the keystore for this short-lived
    // instance
    persistConversations: false,
  });
  storeKeys(address, keys);
}
const client = await Client.create(null, {
  ...clientOptions,
  privateKeyOverride: keys,
});
```

We are using the following helper functions to store and retrieve the keys

```ts [TypeScript]
// Create a client using keys returned from getKeys
const ENCODING = "binary";

export const getEnv = (): "dev" | "production" | "local" => {
  return "production";
};

export const buildLocalStorageKey = (walletAddress: string) =>
  walletAddress ? `xmtp:${getEnv()}:keys:${walletAddress}` : "";

export const loadKeys = (walletAddress: string): Uint8Array | null => {
  const val = localStorage.getItem(buildLocalStorageKey(walletAddress));
  return val ? Buffer.from(val, ENCODING) : null;
};

export const storeKeys = (walletAddress: string, keys: Uint8Array) => {
  localStorage.setItem(
    buildLocalStorageKey(walletAddress),
    Buffer.from(keys).toString(ENCODING),
  );
};

export const wipeKeys = (walletAddress: string) => {
  // This will clear the conversation cache + the private keys
  localStorage.removeItem(buildLocalStorageKey(walletAddress));
};
```
</div>

<div data-title="React">
```jsx [JavaScript]
import { Client, useClient } from "@xmtp/react-sdk";
import type { Signer } from "@xmtp/react-sdk";

export const CreateClientWithKeys: React.FC<{ signer: Signer }> = ({ signer }) => {
  const { initialize } = useClient();

  const initXmtpWithKeys = async () => {
    const options = {
      env: "dev"
    };
    const address = await getAddress(signer);
    let keys = loadKeys(address);
    if (!keys) {
      keys = await Client.getKeys(signer, {
        ...options,
        skipContactPublishing: true,
        persistConversations: false,
      });
      storeKeys(address, keys);
    }
    await initialize({ keys, options, signer });
  };

  // initialize client on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    void initXmtpWithKeys();
  }, []);

  return (
    ...
  );
};
```

We are using the following helper functions to store and retrieve the keys

```ts [TypeScript]
// Create a client using keys returned from getKeys
const ENCODING = "binary";

export const getEnv = (): "dev" | "production" | "local" => {
  return "production";
};

export const buildLocalStorageKey = (walletAddress: string) =>
  walletAddress ? `xmtp:${getEnv()}:keys:${walletAddress}` : "";

export const loadKeys = (walletAddress: string): Uint8Array | null => {
  const val = localStorage.getItem(buildLocalStorageKey(walletAddress));
  return val ? Buffer.from(val, ENCODING) : null;
};

export const storeKeys = (walletAddress: string, keys: Uint8Array) => {
  localStorage.setItem(
    buildLocalStorageKey(walletAddress),
    Buffer.from(keys).toString(ENCODING),
  );
};

export const wipeKeys = (walletAddress: string) => {
  // This will clear the conversation cache + the private keys
  localStorage.removeItem(buildLocalStorageKey(walletAddress));
};
```
</div>

<div data-title="Kotlin">
```kotlin [Kotlin]
// Create the client with a `SigningKey` from your app
val options =
    ClientOptions(
        api = ClientOptions.Api(env = XMTPEnvironment.PRODUCTION, isSecure = true)
    )
val client = Client().create(account = account, options = options)

// Get the key bundle
val keys = client.privateKeyBundleV1

// Serialize the key bundle and store it somewhere safe
val serializedKeys = PrivateKeyBundleV1Builder.encodeData(v1)
```

Once you have those keys, you can create a new client with `Client().buildFrom()`:

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val keys = PrivateKeyBundleV1Builder.fromEncodedData(serializedKeys)
val client = Client().buildFrom(bundle = keys, options = options)
```
</div>

<div data-title="Swift">
```swift [Swift]
// Create the client with a `SigningKey` from your app
let client = try await Client.create(
  account: account, options: .init(api: .init(env: .production)))

// Get the key bundle
let keys = client.privateKeyBundle

// Serialize the key bundle and store it somewhere safe
let keysData = try keys.serializedData()
```

Once you have those keys, you can create a new client with `Client.from`:

```swift [Swift]
let keys = try PrivateKeyBundle(serializedData: keysData)
let client = try Client.from(bundle: keys, options: .init(api: .init(env: .production)))
```
</div>

<div data-title="React Native">
You can export the unencrypted key bundle using the static method `Client.exportKeyBundle`, save it somewhere secure, and then provide those keys at a later time to initialize a new client using the exported XMTP identity.

```js [JavaScript]
import { Client } from "@xmtp/xmtp-react-native";
// Get the keys using a valid Signer. Save them somewhere secure.
const keys = await Client.exportKeyBundle(xmtp.address);
//Save the keys
storeKeyBundle(xmtp.address, keys);
//Load the keys
let keys = await loadKeyBundle(address);
// Create a client using keys returned from getKeys
const xmtp = await Client.createFromKeyBundle(keys, clientOptions);
```

In this example we are using `AsyncStorage` external library to save the key bundle

```js [JavaScript]
export const buildLocalStorageKey = (walletAddress) => {
  return walletAddress ? `xmtp:${getEnv()}:keys:${walletAddress}` : "";
};

export const loadKeyBundle = async (address) => {
  const keyBundle = await AsyncStorage.getItem(buildLocalStorageKey(address));
  return keyBundle;
};
export const storeKeyBundle = async (address, keyBundle) => {
  await AsyncStorage.setItem(buildLocalStorageKey(address), keyBundle);
};
export const wipeKeyBundle = async (address) => {
  await AsyncStorage.removeItem(buildLocalStorageKey(address));
};
```

The keys returned by `exportKeyBundle` should be treated with the utmost care as compromise of these keys will allow an attacker to impersonate the user on the XMTP network. Ensure these keys are stored somewhere secure and encrypted.

## Create an XMTP client with a private key

You can create an XMTP client with a private key using a compatible client library.

:::code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
import { Client } from "@xmtp/xmtp-js";

const privateKey = "your_private_key";

//ethers
import { Wallet } from "ethers";
const signer = new Wallet();

//viem
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
const hexPrivateKey = `0x${privateKey}`;
const signer = privateKeyToAccount(hexPrivateKey);

// Create the client with a `Signer` from your application
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, { env: "dev" });
```

```tsx [React]
import { useClient } from "@xmtp/react-sdk";

const privateKey = "your_private_key";

//ethers
import { Wallet } from "ethers";
const signer = new Wallet(privateKey);

//viem
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
const hexPrivateKey = `0x${privateKey}`;
const signer = privateKeyToAccount(hexPrivateKey);

//Using react hooks
const { client, error, isLoading, initialize } = useClient();
await initialize({ keys, options, signer });
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
// Create the client with a `SigningKey` from your app
val options =
    ClientOptions(
        api = ClientOptions.Api(env = XMTPEnvironment.PRODUCTION, isSecure = true)
    )
val client = Client().create(account = account, options = options)
```

```swift [Swift]
func dataFromHexString(_ hex: String) -> Data? {
    var data = Data(capacity: hex.count / 2)
    var buffer = 0
    var index = 0
    for char in hex {
        if let value = char.hexDigitValue {
            if index % 2 == 0 {
                buffer = value << 4
            } else {
                buffer |= value
                data.append(UInt8(buffer))
            }
            index += 1
        } else {
            return nil
        }
    }
    return data
}

let privateKeyString = "your_private_key"
if let privateKeyData = dataFromHexString(privateKeyString) {
let privateKey = try PrivateKey(privateKeyData)
let client = try await Client.create(account: privateKey, options: ClientOptions(api: .init(env: .production)))
```

```tsx [React Native]
import { Client } from "@xmtp/xmtp-react-native";
import { Wallet } from "ethers";

const privateKey = "your_key";
const provider = new ethers.InfuraProvider("mainnet", "your_infura_token");
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer);
```

## Configure the client

Configure a client's network connection and other options using these client creation parameters:

Set the `env` client option to `dev` while developing. Set it to `production` before you launch.

:::

## XMTP network environments

XMTP identity on `dev` network is completely distinct from its XMTP identity on the `production` network, as are the messages associated with these identities.

- `production`: This network is used in production and is configured to store messages indefinitely.

  - Try the web inbox at [https://xmtp.chat/](https://xmtp.chat/).

  - Send a message to our `gm` bot to get started. `gm.xmtp.eth`

- `dev`: XMTP may occasionally delete messages and keys from this network

  - Try the web dev inbox at [https://dev.xmtp.chat/](https://xmtp.chat/).

  - Send a message to our `gm` bot to get started. `0x8DC925338C1eE1fE62c0C43404371deb701BfB55`

- `local`: Use to have a client communicate with an XMTP node you are running locally. For example, an XMTP node developer can set `env` to `local` to generate client traffic to test a node running locally.
