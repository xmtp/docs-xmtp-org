# Handle group chat permissions

Robust group chat permissions are key to providing users with a friendly and safe group chat experience.

These are the current permissions allowed for a group:

- Add member
- Remove member
- Update metadata
- Add admin
- Remove admin
- Update permissions

## Permission options

These are the permission options available for each permission:

- Unspecified
- Allow
- Deny
- Allow if admin or super admin
- Allow if super admin

You can list, add, and remove members from a group chat. Only the group chat creator (super admin) has permission to add or remove members. This restriction ensures that only authorized individuals can modify the participant list.

## Manage group chat admins

There are two kinds of administrators:Â super admins and admins. The group creator starts as a super admin, who has the most permissions so that a normal admin cannot remove the creator or destroy a group.

Here's an overview of how group chat admin statuses work:

- Everyone in a group chat is a member.
- A member can be granted admin or super admin status.  
If the member's admin or super admin status is removed, they are still a member of the group chat. 
- By default, only a member with super admin can add and remove admin and super admin statuses.  
Also by default, the group creator is the only member with super admin status.

By design, checking admin permission status by wallet address is not supported. Instead, look up the `inboxID` for that wallet address, then use the calls below.

### Check if inbox ID is an admin

:::code-group

```jsx [JavaScript]
// Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
const isAdmin = await.group.isAdmin(adminClient.inboxID)
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
//Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
val isInboxIDAdmin = group.isAdmin(inboxId)
```

```swift [Swift]
// Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
try group.isAdmin(client.inboxID)
```

```tsx [Node]
// this API is experimental and may change in the future

const isAdmin = group.isAdmin(inboxId);
```

:::

### Check if inbox ID is a super admin

:::code-group

```jsx [JavaScript]
//Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
const isSuperAdmin = await group.isSuperAdmin(client.inboxID)
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
//Assume group is an existing group chat object for client
val isInboxIDSuperAdmin = group.isSuperAdmin(inboxId)
```

```swift [Swift]
try group.isSuperAdmin(inboxid: inboxID)
```

```tsx [Node]
// this API is experimental and may change in the future
