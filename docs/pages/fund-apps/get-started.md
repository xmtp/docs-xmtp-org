ðŸŽ¤ **TL;DR: What You Need To Know**

- **XMTP mainnet launches July 29, 2025** with mandatory fees starting December 9, 2025
- **Three key preparation steps**: Set up your payer service, calculate costs and fund your account
- **Fees start at $5 per 100,000 messages** to cover shared network infrastructure costsâ€”100% goes to node operators
- **Most apps will pay $30â€“$3,000 per month** depending on user base and optimization
- **Client libraries available October 7, 2025**â€”the final step after you've prepared everything else

## Whatâ€™s Changing

The decentralized XMTP network is moving from testnet to mainnetâ€”a significant transition affecting everyone building on the protocol. This milestone represents the culmination of three years of development and marks a major step toward a fully decentralized messaging layer for the open web.

### Key Changes Coming with Mainnet

- **Decentralized infrastructure:** Messages will be routed through a network of independent nodes instead of our testnet servers
- **Mandatory message fees:** All messages will require payment to support this decentralized infrastructure
- **Production-ready stability:** The protocol will stabilize with long-term backward compatibility guarantees
- **Governance participation:** Node operators and active participants will help guide protocol evolution

### Why This Matters for Your App

This transition requires action from all developers to ensure uninterrupted service. Unlike API-based services where price changes happen behind the scenes, XMTP's decentralized nature means you'll need to:

- **Set up payment infrastructure** to fund message delivery
- **Manage your USDC balance** to ensure continuous service
- **Update client libraries** when they become available

The good news is that mainnet delivers long-term stability and censorship resistance that wasn't possible before. Your messaging infrastructure becomes truly unstoppable and permanently available.

### Why Decentralization Matters

Mainnet transforms XMTP into a **permanent, unstoppable messaging network**. Unlike traditional platforms that can be shut down or censored, mainnet provides:

- **True independence**: No single entity can control your messaging infrastructure
- **Permanent availability**: Your app's communication layer cannot be turned off
- **User sovereignty**: People retain ownership of their conversations and contacts
- **Protocol stability**: Protection from breaking changes and platform risk

### How Messaging Fees Support the Network

XMTP's decentralized approach distributes infrastructure costs across all participants, ensuring the network's sustainability and independence. This differs fundamentally from traditional messaging where a single company controls and monetizes the platform.

Your fees directly fund:

- **Independent node operators** who maintain the global message delivery network
- **Network bandwidth** for reliable global message routing
- **Storage infrastructure** that guarantees message delivery
- **Direct infrastructure costs**â€”100% of fees go to the operators with no middleman markup

You're not paying for access to someone else's platform. You're investing in shared infrastructure that no one can take away from you or your users.

### How XMTP's Architecture Works

XMTP uses a two-layer system to deliver messages efficiently:

1. **Broadcast Network** (Offchain)
    - Handles actual message delivery between users
    - Operated by node operators who route encrypted messages
2. **App Chain** (Onchain)
    - Stores critical metadata like user identities and group membership
    - Essential for decentralized identity and permissions

> The simple version: You pay one price per message that covers everythingâ€”both network delivery and blockchain operations. The technical details of how fees are split between these systems is handled automatically.

# Getting Ready

### Critical Dates

- **Mainnet launches July 29, 2025**â€”this is when you should start preparing and testing
- **October 7, 2025 marks the release of client libraries** and when the Payer Portal begins accepting mainnet deposits
- **On December 9, 2025**, fees will no longer be optionalâ€”your system must be fully operational by this date
