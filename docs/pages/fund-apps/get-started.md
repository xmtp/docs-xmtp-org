# Get started with funding your app to send messages with XMTP

Starting December 9, 2025, apps and agents must pay fees to send messages on the decentralized XMTP Network.

This guide provides a timeline and checklist to prepare your app for this transition.

## Key milestones

- **December 9, 2025**:
  - The decentralized XMTP Network is fully operational.
  - Fees are now required to send messages.

## Required tasks

Complete these tasks by **December 9, 2025**, to ensure your app can send messages on the decentralized XMTP Network.

1. **From August 12**: Deploy the [XMTP Gateway Service](/fund-apps/run-gateway) to enable your app or agent to send messages and pay fees to the XMTP Network and XMTP Appchain.
2. **From August 12 and before December 9**: [Fund your app](/fund-apps/fund-your-app) using the XMTP Funding Portal. We recommend funding 3-6 months of estimated usage.
3. **From October 7**: Update your app to use a [decentralization-ready XMTP SDK](/fund-apps/update-sdk) to connect to your XMTP Gateway Service.

## Recommended next steps

- Learn about [XMTP fees](/fund-apps/understand-fees).
- [Estimate your app's monthly costs](/fund-apps/calculate-costs#estimate-xmtp-fees-and-costs).
- Test your implementation:
  - Verify that your [XMTP Gateway Service](/fund-apps/run-gateway) and [funding](/fund-apps/fund-your-app) are working correctly.
  - Simulate your app's usage to run a thorough a projected cost analysis using the XMTP Funding Portal.
- [Set up monitoring](/fund-apps/run-gateway#metrics-and-observability) and automated tests for your XMTP Gateway Service.
