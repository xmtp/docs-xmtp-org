## Step 3: Fund Your Account

### Setting Up Your Payment Wallet

XMTP accepts **USDC (USD Coin)** for all payments—a stable cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar.

### Creating Your Payer Wallet

1. **Generate a dedicated wallet** for XMTP payments
2. **Store private key securely** (use environment variables/secrets management)
3. **Fund with USDC** via the Payer Portal
4. **Monitor balance** through your payer service metrics

### How the Payer Portal Works

The Payer Portal simplifies blockchain complexity:

1. **You deposit USDC** into your Portal account
2. **Portal manages all payments** from your balance
3. **You monitor one balance** for all message costs

Behind the scenes, the Portal handles smart contract deposits, gas payments, and all blockchain interactions. You just see messages sent and USDC consumed.

### Flexible Funding Options

The Payer Portal supports various funding scenarios:

**Direct funding**: Fund your own apps directly
**Third-party funding**: Anyone can deposit funds on your behalf

- Investors can fund your startup's messaging costs
- Sponsors can cover costs for open-source projects
- Parent companies can fund subsidiary apps

**Managing others' funds**: You can also manage funds for other developers

- Fund multiple projects from one account
- Distribute investor funds to portfolio companies
- Manage messaging budgets across teams

> How it works: The Portal allows deposits to any wallet address. Whether you're funding yourself, being funded by others, or managing funds for a portfolio, the process is the same—deposit USDC to the target wallet through the Portal.
