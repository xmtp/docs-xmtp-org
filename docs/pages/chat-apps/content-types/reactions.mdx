# Support reactions in your app built with XMTP

Use the reaction content type to support reactions in your app. A reaction is a quick and often emoji-based way to respond to a message. Reactions are usually limited to a predefined set of emojis or symbols provided by the chat app.

## Use a local database for performance

Use a local database to store reactions. This enables your app to performantly display a reaction with its [referenced message](#send-a-reaction) when rendering message lists.

### Install the package

For Browser SDK (v6.0.0+) and Node SDK (v5.0.0+), the reaction content type is built-in and does not require separate installation or codec registration.

For other SDKs where the `ReactionCodec` is not already included, you can install the package using the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @xmtp/content-type-reaction
```

:::

## Configure the content type

or Browser SDK (v6.0.0+) and Node SDK (v5.0.0+), reactions are built-in and do not require codec registration. Skip this step for these SDKs.

For other SDKs, register the codec:

:::code-group

```jsx [React Native]
const client = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: 'production',
  codecs: [new ReactionCodec()],
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ReactionCodec

Client.register(codec = ReactionCodec())
```

```swift [Swift]
Client.register(ReactionCodec());
```

## Send a reaction

With XMTP, reactions are represented as objects with the following keys:

- `reference`: ID of the message being reacted to

- `referenceInboxId`: (Optional) Inbox ID of the sender of the message being reacted to. This helps with message attribution in group conversations.

- `action`: Action of the reaction (added or removed)

- `content`: String representation of the reaction (smile, for example) to be interpreted by clients

- `schema`: Schema of the reaction (Unicode, shortcode, or custom)

:::code-group

```tsx [Browser]
const reaction = {
  reference: someMessageID,
  referenceInboxId: messageSenderInboxId, // Optional: Inbox ID of the message sender
  action: 'added',
  content: 'smile',
  schema: 'shortcode',
};

await conversation.sendReaction(reaction);
```

```tsx [Node]
const reaction = {
  reference: someMessageID,
  referenceInboxId: messageSenderInboxId, // Optional: Inbox ID of the message sender
  action: 'added',
  content: 'smile',
  schema: 'shortcode',
};

await conversation.sendReaction(reaction);
```

```jsx [React Native]
// Assuming you have a conversation object and the ID of the message you're reacting to
const reactionContent = {
  reaction: {
    reference: messageId, // ID of the message you're reacting to
    referenceInboxId: messageSenderInboxId, // Optional: Inbox ID of the message sender
    action: 'added', // Action can be 'added' or 'removed'
    schema: 'unicode', // Schema can be 'unicode', 'shortcode', or 'custom'
    content: '👍', // Content of the reaction
  },
};

await conversation.send(reactionContent);
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.Reaction
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ReactionAction
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ReactionSchema
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ContentTypeReaction
import org.xmtp.android.library.SendOptions

val reaction = Reaction(
    reference = messageToReact.id, // the ID of the message you're reacting to
    referenceInboxId = messageSenderInboxId, // Optional: Inbox ID of the message sender
    action = ReactionAction.Added, // the action of the reaction
    content = "U+1F603", // the content of the reaction
    schema = ReactionSchema.Unicode // the schema of the reaction
)
conversation.send(
    content = reaction,
    options = SendOptions(contentType = ContentTypeReaction)
)

```

```swift [Swift]
let reaction = Reaction(
    reference: messageToReact.id,
    referenceInboxId: messageSenderInboxId, // Optional: Inbox ID of the message sender
    action: .added,
    content: "U+1F603",
    schema: .unicode
)

try await conversation.send(
    content: reaction,
    options: .init(contentType: ContentTypeReaction)
)
```

:::

## Receive a reaction

Now that you can send a reaction, you need a way to receive a reaction. For example:

:::code-group

```tsx [Browser]
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReaction)) {
  // We've got a reaction.
  const reaction: Reaction = message.content;
}
```

```jsx [React Native]
if (message.contentTypeId === 'xmtp.org/reaction:1.0') {
  const reaction = message.content();
  return reaction;
  //reaction.reference = id of the message being reacted to,
  //reaction.action = 'added',
  //reaction.schema =  'unicode',
  //reaction.content = '💖',
}
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
if (message.contentType == ContentTypeReaction) {
    // The message is a reaction
    val reactionCodec = ReactionCodec()
    val reaction: Reaction = reactionCodec.decode(message.content)
}
```

```swift [Swift]
let content: Reaction = try message.content()
```

To handle unsupported content types, refer to the [fallback](/chat-apps/content-types/fallback) section.

## Display the reaction

Generally, reactions should be interpreted as emoji. So, "smile" would translate to 😄 in UI clients. That being said, how you ultimately choose to render a reaction in your app is up to you.

## Notifications and reactions

Reactions have `shouldPush` set to `false`, which means that reactions do not trigger push notifications as long as the notification server respects this flag.
