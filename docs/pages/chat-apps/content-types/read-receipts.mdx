# Support read receipts in your app built with XMTP

Use the read receipt content type to support read receipts in your app. A read receipt is a `timestamp` that indicates when a message was read. It is sent as a message and can be used to calculate the time since the last message was read.

## Provide an opt-out option

While this is a per-app decision, the best practice is to provide users with the option to opt out of sending read receipts. If a user opts out, when they read a message, a read receipt will not be sent to the sender of the message.

## Install the package

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @xmtp/content-type-read-receipt
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @xmtp/content-type-read-receipt
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @xmtp/content-type-read-receipt
```

:::

## Configure the content type

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
import { ReadReceiptCodec } from '@xmtp/content-type-read-receipt';
// Create the XMTP client
const xmtp = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: 'dev',
  codecs: [new ReadReceiptCodec()],
});
```

```js [React Native]
const client = await Client.create(signer, {
  env: 'production',
  codecs: [new ReadReceiptCodec()],
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
import org.xmtp.android.library.Client
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ReadReceiptCodec

Client.register(codec = ReadReceiptCodec())
```

```swift [Swift]
 Client.register(codec: ReadReceiptCodec())
```

## Send a read receipt

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
// The content of a read receipt message must be an empty object.

await conversation.messages.send({}, ContentTypeReadReceipt);
```

```jsx [React Native]
await bobConversation.send({ readReceipt: {} });
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
import org.xmtp.android.library.Client
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ReadReceipt
import org.xmtp.android.library.codecs.ContentTypeReadReceipt
import org.xmtp.android.library.messages.SendOptions

// Create a ReadReceipt instance
val readReceipt = ReadReceipt

// Send the read receipt
aliceConversation.send(
    content = readReceipt,
    options = SendOptions(contentType = ContentTypeReadReceipt),
)
```

```swift [Swift]
let read = ReadReceipt(timestamp: "2019-09-26T07:58:30.996+0200")

try await conversation.send(
    content: read,
    options: .init(contentType: ContentTypeReadReceipt)
)
```

## Receive a read receipt

Here's how you can receive a read receipt:

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReadReceipt)) {
  // The message is a read receipt
  const timestamp = message.sent;
}
```

```js [React Native]
if (message.contentTypeId === 'xmtp.org/readReceipt:1.0') {
  return message.sent; //Date received
}
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
val message: DecodedMessage = conversation.messages().first()
if (message.encodedContent.type == ContentTypeReadReceipt) {
    // The message is a ReadReceipt
    val readReceipt: ReadReceipt? = message.content()
    if (readReceipt != null) {
      println("Message read at: ${message.sent}")
    }
}
```

```swift [Swift]
let content: ReadReceipt = try message.content()
content.timestamp // "2019-09-26T07:58:30.996+0200"
```

## Display a read receipt

`ReadReceipts` have an `undefined` or `nil` fallback, indicating the message is not expected to be displayed. To learn more, see [Handle unsupported content types](/chat-apps/content-types/fallback) section.

## Notifications and read receipts

Read receipts have `shouldPush` set to `false`, which means that read receipts do not trigger push notifications as long as the notification server respects this flag.

## Use a read receipt

Generally, a read receipt indicator should be displayed under the message it's associated with. The indicator can include a timestamp. Ultimately, how you choose to display a read receipt indicator is completely up to you.

The read receipt is provided as an **empty message** whose timestamp provides the data needed for the indicators. **Be sure to filter out read receipt empty messages and not display them to users.**

You can use a read receipt timestamp to calculate the time since the last message was read. While iterating through messages, you can be sure that the last message was read at the timestamp of the read receipt if the string of the timestamp is lower.
