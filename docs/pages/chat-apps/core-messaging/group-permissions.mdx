# Manage group permissions

Robust group chat permissions are key to providing users with a friendly and safe group chat experience.

## Understand the group permissions system

### Member statuses

Member statuses are the roles that can be assigned to each participant (inbox ID) in a group chat. These are the available member statuses:

- Member
  - Everyone in a group chat is a member. A member can be granted admin or super admin status. If a member's admin or super admin status is removed, they are still a member of the group.
- Admin
- Super admin

### Options

Use options to assign a role to a permission. These are the available options:

- All members
- Admin only
  - Includes super admins
- Super admin only

### Permissions

Permissions are the actions a group chat participant can be allowed to take. These are the available permissions:

- Grant admin status to a member
- Remove admin status from a member
- Add a member to the group
- Remove a member from the group
- Update [group metadata](/chat-apps/core-messaging/group-metadata), such as group name, description, and image
- Update group permissions on an item-by-item basis, such as calling `updateNamePermission` or `updateAddMemberPermission` . To learn more, see [Group.kt](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-android/blob/main/library/src/main/java/org/xmtp/android/library/Group.kt#L251-L313) in the xmtp-android SDK repo.

The following permissions can be assigned by super admins only. This helps ensure that a “regular” admin cannot remove the super admin or otherwise destroy a group.

- Grant super admin status to a member
- Remove super admin status from a member
- Update group permissions

## How the group permissions system works

When a group is created, all groups have the same initial member "roles" set:

- There is one super admin, and it is the group creator
- There are no admins
- Each user added to the group starts out as a member

The super admin has all of the [available permissions](#permissions) and can use them to adjust the group's permissions and options.

As the app developer, you can provide a UI that enables group participants to make further adjustments. For example, you can give the super admin the following permission options for group members when creating the group:

- Add members
- Update group metadata

<div>
  <img

    width="300px"
    alt="UI screenshot showing group permission toggle options including Add members and Edit group info settings"
  />
</div>

You can use member statuses, options, and permissions to create a custom policy set. The following table represents the valid policy options for each of the permissions:

| Permission               | Allow all | Deny all | Admin only | Super admin only |
| ------------------------ | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Add member               | ✅        | ✅       | ✅         | ✅               |
| Remove member            | ✅        | ✅       | ✅         | ✅               |
| Add admin                | ❌        | ✅       | ✅         | ✅               |
| Remove admin             | ❌        | ✅       | ✅         | ✅               |
| Update group permissions | ❌        | ❌       | ❌         | ✅               |
| Update group metadata    | ✅        | ✅       | ✅         | ✅               |

If you aren't opinionated and don't set any permissions and options, groups will default to using the delivered `All_Members` policy set, which applies the following permissions and options:

- Add member - All members
- Remove member - Admin only
- Add admin - Super admin only
- Remove admin - Super admin only
- Update group permissions - Super admin only
- Update group metadata - All members

To learn more about the `All_Members` and `Admin_Only` policy sets, see [group_permissions.rs](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/blob/85dd6d36f46db1ed74fe98273eea6871fea2e078/xmtp_mls/src/groups/group_permissions.rs#L1192-L1226) in the LibXMTP repo.
