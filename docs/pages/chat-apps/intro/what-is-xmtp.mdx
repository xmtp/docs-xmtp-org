# What is XMTP?

XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) is an open protocol and decentralized network for secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging. It enables developers to build messaging experiences where users own their identity, conversations, and data.

## Protocol and network

XMTP consists of two layers:

- **The protocol** defines how messages are formatted, encrypted, and exchanged. It uses the [Messaging Layer Security (MLS)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html) standard—a ratified IETF specification that provides end-to-end encryption with forward secrecy and post-compromise security.

- **The network** is the infrastructure that stores and relays encrypted messages between clients.
  - **Today's network**: The `dev` and `production` network environments are operated by [XMTP Labs](https://www.xmtplabs.com/) and powered by [xmtp-node-go](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-node-go).
  - **Decentralized network**: In parallel, a decentralized network of independent nodes is being built. The testnet launched a year ago, and mainnet is coming. Messages on the decentralized network are quantum-resistant encrypted and retained for 60 days before automatically expiring. To learn more about progress toward decentralization, see [Decentralizing XMTP](https://xmtp.org/decentralization).

## Identity and inboxes

Every user has a cryptographic **inbox** identified by an **InboxID**. The following identities (blockchain wallet addresses) can link to a single inbox through signed cryptographic associations:

- Externally owned accounts (EOAs)
- Smart contract wallets
- ERC-4337 accounts

These identities may themselves be linked to social identifiers like ENS, Base, or Zora names, as well as proof-of-personhood systems like World ID.

Each inbox designates a **recovery authority** that can revoke compromised associations or transfer control, preventing lockouts when credentials are lost. No email or phone number authentication is required.

To learn more, see [Manage XMTP inboxes, identities, and installations](/chat-apps/core-messaging/manage-inboxes).

## Message types

XMTP supports two conversation formats:

- **1:1 direct messages (DMs)**: Conversations between two participants
- **Group chats**: Multi-party conversations with configurable permissions and metadata

Both humans and agents can participate in DMs and group chats.

## Content types

XMTP uses content types to encode all message content, including:    

- Text
- Attachments (images, files, audio, video)
- Onchain transactions
- Onchain transaction references
- Reactions
- Replies
- Read receipts
- Custom content types defined by developers

To learn more, see [Understand content types](/chat-apps/content-types/content-types).

## Spam protection

Spam protection is provided via consent preferences, which are stored on-device and synced through [device sync](/chat-apps/list-stream-sync/history-sync). This enables users to maintain consistent contact preferences across all XMTP-compatible apps:

- **Allowed**: Contacts whose messages appear in the main inbox
- **Unknown**: New contacts requiring acceptance/rejection
- **Denied**: Blocked contacts whose messages are filtered out

Only the user can see their consent list—blocked contacts are never notified of their status.

To learn more, see [Understand how user consent preferences support spam-free chats](/chat-apps/user-consent/user-consent).

## Security model

XMTP and MLS prioritize security, privacy, and message integrity through advanced cryptographic techniques, delivering end-to-end encryption for both 1:1 and group conversations.

To learn more, see [Messaging security properties with XMTP](/protocol/security).

A security assessment of [LibXMTP](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp) and its use of Messaging Layer Security (MLS) was completed by NCC Group in Dec 2024.

See [Public Report: XMTP MLS Implementation Review](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/public-report-xmtp-mls-implementation-review/).

## Crypto-native capabilities

XMTP is built on blockchain rails, enabling native integration with:

- Support for any blockchain or payment protocol
- Transaction messages with embedded context
- Agent-based automation for payments and fund management
- Token-gated communities and features

## Interoperability and ownership

Because XMTP is a protocol, not a platform:

- Users can access their messages from any app built with XMTP
- Developers maintain full control without platform lock-in
- The protocol is censorship-resistant and not controlled by a central authority
- Apps and agents can interoperate seamlessly
