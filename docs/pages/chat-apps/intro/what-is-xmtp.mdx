# What is XMTP?

XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol) is an open protocol and decentralized network for secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging. It enables developers to build messaging experiences where users own their identity, conversations, and data.

## Protocol and network

XMTP consists of two layers:

- **The protocol** defines how messages are formatted, encrypted, and exchanged. It uses the [Messaging Layer Security (MLS)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html) standard—a ratified IETF specification that provides end-to-end encryption with forward secrecy and post-compromise security.

- **The broadcast network** is a decentralized infrastructure of nodes that store and relay encrypted messages. Messages are quantum-resistant encrypted and retained for 60 days by default, then automatically expire.

To learn more about the path to decentralization, see [Decentralizing XMTP](https://xmtp.org/decentralization).

## Identity and inboxes

Every user has a cryptographic **inbox** identified by an **InboxID**. Multiple identities can link to a single inbox through signed cryptographic associations:

- Blockchain wallets (EOAs, smart contract wallets, ERC-4337 accounts)
- Social identities (ENS names, Base handles, Zora usernames)
- Proof-of-personhood systems (World ID)

Each inbox designates a **recovery authority** that can revoke compromised associations or transfer control, preventing lockouts when credentials are lost. No email or phone number authentication is required.

To learn more, see [Manage XMTP inboxes, identities, and installations](/chat-apps/core-messaging/manage-inboxes).

## Message types

XMTP supports multiple conversation formats:

- **1:1 direct messages (DMs)**: Private conversations between two users
- **Group chats**: Multi-party conversations with configurable permissions and metadata
- **Agent messaging**: Automated or AI-powered agents that can send and receive messages

## Spam protection

Spam protection is provided via consent preferences, which are stored on the XMTP network, not in individual apps. This enables users to maintain consistent contact preferences across all XMTP-compatible apps:

- **Allowed**: Contacts whose messages appear in the main inbox
- **Unknown**: New contacts requiring acceptance/rejection
- **Denied**: Blocked contacts whose messages are filtered out

Only the user can see their consent list—blocked contacts are never notified of their status.

To learn more, see [Understand how user consent preferences support spam-free chats](/chat-apps/user-consent/user-consent).

## Content types

While XMTP handles text messages natively, it's extensible to support rich content:

- Attachments (images, files, audio, video)
- Reactions and replies
- Read receipts
- Onchain transaction messages and references
- Custom content types defined by developers

To learn more, see [Understand content types](/chat-apps/content-types/content-types).

## Security model

XMTP and MLS prioritize security, privacy, and message integrity through advanced cryptographic techniques, delivering end-to-end encryption for both 1:1 and group conversations.

To learn more, see [Messaging security properties with XMTP](/protocol/security).

A security assessment of [LibXMTP](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp) and its use of Messaging Layer Security (MLS) was completed by NCC Group in Dec 2024.

See [Public Report: XMTP MLS Implementation Review](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/public-report-xmtp-mls-implementation-review/).

## Crypto-native capabilities

XMTP is built on blockchain rails, enabling native integration with:

- Support for any blockchain or payment protocol
- Transaction messages with embedded context
- Agent-based automation for payments and fund management
- Token-gated communities and features

## Interoperability and ownership

Because XMTP is a protocol, not a platform:

- Users can access their messages from any app built with XMTP
- Developers maintain full control without platform lock-in
- The protocol is censorship-resistant and not controlled by a central authority
- Apps and agents can interoperate seamlessly

## Platform support

- Web SDKs for [Browser](/chat-apps/sdks/browser) and [Node.js](/chat-apps/sdks/node)
- Mobile SDKs for [React Native](/chat-apps/sdks/react-native), [Android](/chat-apps/sdks/android), and [iOS](/chat-apps/sdks/ios)
- [Agent SDK](/agents/get-started/build-an-agent)
