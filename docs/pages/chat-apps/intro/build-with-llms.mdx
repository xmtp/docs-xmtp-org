# Use XMTP documentation with AI coding assistants

To make it easier for you to build with XMTP using LLMs and coding assistants, we offer the following AI-ready documentation files.

If you're using an AI coding assistant that allows custom context, you can upload or point to the appropriate file to enhance your development experience with XMTP. Using the file focused on your builder use case (chat apps or agents) typically provides better AI performance.

## For building chat apps

Use `llms-chat-apps.txt`: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-chat-apps.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-chat-apps.txt)

Includes: Core messaging, content types, push notifications, user consent, protocol fundamentals, network operations, and funding information.

## For building agents

Use `llms-agents.txt`: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-agents.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-agents.txt)

Includes: Agent concepts, building and deploying agents, agent-specific content types, protocol fundamentals, network operations, and funding information.

## For comprehensive coverage

Use `llms-full.txt`: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-full.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/main/llms/llms-full.txt)
