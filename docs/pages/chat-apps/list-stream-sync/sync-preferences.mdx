# Sync preferences

You can sync the following preference-related information across multiple existing app installations:

- Conversation [consent preferences](/chat-apps/user-consent/user-consent#how-user-consent-preferences-are-set)
- Conversation HMAC keys (for [push notifications](/chat-apps/push-notifs/understand-push-notifs))

## Databases used by preferences sync

Each XMTP node contains:

- A **welcomes database**: Keeps a ledger of all groups an inbox ID is a part of.
- A **group messages database**: Keeps a ledger of all messages in the groups an inbox ID is a part of.

  />
</div>

In the welcomes database, the groups are of these types:

- **1:1 chat**: A group that handles conversations between an inbox ID and one other user.
- **Group chat**: A group that handles conversations between an inbox ID and multiple other users.
- **Preferences**: A group that handles syncing preferences between an inbox ID's existing app installations.

One-to-one chat, group chat, and preferences groups in the welcome database are updated by apps as follows:

- 1:1 chats
  - `conversations.list`
  - `syncAll`
  - `streamAll`
- Group chats
  - `conversations.list`
  - `syncAll`
  - `streamAll`
- Preferences
  - `preferences.sync`
  - `syncAll`

## Preferences group

To describe preference sync, let's first focus on how the preferences group works.

1. A preferences group has one member, which is one inbox ID.

2. Let's say Inbox ID Alix has an Installation A of App A on their phone. At this time, Inbox ID Alix has a preferences group that looks like this:

   <div>
     <img
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/pg-1.png"
       width="300px"
       alt="Diagram showing preferences group with one member (Inbox ID Alix) and Installation A of App A"
     />
   </div>

3. Inbox ID Alix then logs in to an Installation B of App B on their phone. The next time Installation A runs `preferences.sync` or `syncAll`, it updates the preferences group as follows:

   <div>
     <img
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/pg-2.png"
       width="300px"
       alt="Diagram showing preferences group updated to include Installation B of App B after Alix logs in to a second app"
     />
   </div>

4. Then let's say Inbox ID Alix logs in to an Installation C of App A on their tablet. The next time Installation A or B runs `preferences.sync` or `syncAll`, it updates the preferences group as follows:

   <div>
     <img
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/pg-3.png"
       width="300px"
       alt="Diagram showing preferences group updated to include Installation C of App A on tablet after Alix logs in to a third installation"
     />
   </div>

## Preferences sync worker

Now, let's describe how the preferences sync worker helps keep user consent preferences in sync across existing app installations.

1. Let's say Inbox ID Alix uses Installation A to block Inbox ID Bo.

   <div>
     <img
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/a-block-bo.png"
       width="200px"
       alt="Diagram showing Installation A blocking Inbox ID Bo"
     />
   </div>

2. This sends a message to the preferences group in the group message database. This is not an actual chat message, but a serialized proto message that is not shown to app users.

   <div>
     <img
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/gm-pg.png"
       width="300px"
       alt="Diagram showing serialized proto message sent to preferences group in the group message database"
     />
   </div>

3. When Installation B calls `preferences.sync` or `syncAll`, it gets the message from the preferences group. The sync worker listens for these preferences group messages and processes the message to block Inbox ID Bo in Installation B.

   <div>
     <img
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/b-block-bo.png"
       width="200px"
       alt="Diagram showing Installation B processing the sync message to block Inbox ID Bo"
     />
   </div>

4. Likewise, when Installation C calls `preferences.sync` or `syncAll`, it gets the message from the preferences group, and the sync worker ensures Inbox ID Bo is blocked there as well.

   <div>
     <img
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmtp/docs-xmtp-org/refs/heads/main/docs/pages/img/c-block-bo.png"
       width="200px"
       alt="Diagram showing Installation C processing the sync message to block Inbox ID Bo"
     />
   </div>

Preferences sync handles HMAC keys in the same way.

For example, it will handle syncing an HMAC key shared by Installation B to other installations. When Installation A and C call `preferences.sync` or `syncAll`, the sync worker gets Installation B's HMAC key message from the preferences group and ensures that Installation A and C get the HMAC key for Installation B.

## Sync preferences

Use this call to sync preferences (consent preferences and HMAC keys) across app installations in a preferences group. This will also sync welcomes to ensure that you have all potential new installations before syncing.

This is a lighter-weight alternative to syncing preferences using [`syncAll`](/chat-apps/list-stream-sync/sync-and-syncall).
