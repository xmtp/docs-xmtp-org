# List conversations

## List existing conversations

Get a list of existing group chat and DM conversations in the local database.

By default, `list` returns only conversations with a [consent state](/chat-apps/user-consent/user-consent#how-user-consent-preferences-are-set) of allowed or unknown.

We recommend listing allowed conversations only. This ensures that spammy conversations with a consent state of unknown don't degrade the user experience.

To list all conversations regardless of consent state, use the `consentStates` option and pass all three consent states.

Conversations are listed in descending order by their `lastMessage` created at value. If a conversation has no messages, the conversation is ordered by its `createdAt` value.

```js [Browser]
const allConversations = await client.conversations.list({
  consentStates: [ConsentState.Allowed],
});
const allGroups = await client.conversations.listGroups({
  consentStates: [ConsentState.Allowed],
});
const allDms = await client.conversations.listDms({
  consentStates: [ConsentState.Allowed],
});
```

```js [Node]
const allConversations = await client.conversations.list({
  consentStates: [ConsentState.Allowed],
});
const allGroups = await client.conversations.listGroups({
  consentStates: [ConsentState.Allowed],
});
const allDms = await client.conversations.listDms({
  consentStates: [ConsentState.Allowed],
});
```

```tsx [React Native]
// List Conversation items
await alix.conversations.list(['allowed']);

// List Conversation items and return only the fields set to true. Optimize data transfer
// by requesting only the fields the app needs.
await alix.conversations.list({
  members: false,
  consentState: false,
  description: false,
  creatorInboxId: false,
  addedByInboxId: false,
  isActive: false,
  lastMessage: true,
});
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
// List conversations (both groups and dms)
val conversations = alix.conversations.list()
val filteredConversations = client.conversations.list(consentState = ConsentState.ALLOWED)

// List just dms
val dms = alix.conversations.listDms()
val filteredDms = client.conversations.listDms(consentState = ConsentState.ALLOWED)

//List just groups
val groups = alix.conversations.listGroups()
val filteredGroups = client.conversations.listGroups(consentState = ConsentState.ALLOWED)

```

```swift [Swift]
// List conversations (both groups and dms)
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.list()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.list(consentState: .allowed)

// List just dms
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.listDms()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.listDms(consentState: .allowed)

//List just groups
let conversations = try await alix.conversations.listGroups()
let orderFilteredConversations = try await client.conversations.listGroups(consentState: .allowed)
```

## List a user's active conversations

The `isActive()` method determines whether the current user is still an active member of a group conversation. For example:

- When a user is added to a group, `isActive()` returns `true` for that user
- When a user is removed from a group, `isActive()` returns `false` for that user

You can use a user's `isActive: true` value as a filter parameter when listing conversations. You can potentially have a separate section for "archived" or "inactive" conversations where you could use `isActive: false`.
