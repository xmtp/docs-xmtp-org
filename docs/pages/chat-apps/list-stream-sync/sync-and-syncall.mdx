# Sync conversations and messages

:::tip[Note]
Syncing does not refetch existing conversations and messages. It also does not fetch messages for group chats you are no longer a part of.

## Sync a specific conversation

Get all new messages and group updates (name, description, etc.) for a specific conversation from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversation.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversation.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversation.sync()
```

:::

## Sync new conversations

Get any new group chat or DM conversations from the network.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.sync();
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.sync()
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.sync()

## Sync all new welcomes, conversations, messages, and preferences

Sync all new welcomes, group chat and DM conversations, messages, and [preference updates](/chat-apps/list-stream-sync/sync-preferences) from the network.

By default, `syncAll` streams only conversations with a [consent state](/chat-apps/user-consent/user-consent#how-user-consent-preferences-are-set) of allowed or unknown.

We recommend streaming messages for allowed conversations only. This ensures that spammy conversations with a consent state of unknown don't take up networking resources. This also ensures that unwanted spam messages aren't stored in the user's local database.

To sync all conversations regardless of consent state, pass `[ALLOWED, UNKNOWN, DENIED]`.

To sync preferences only, you can call [`preferences.sync`](/chat-apps/list-stream-sync/sync-preferences). Note that `preferences.sync` will also sync welcomes to ensure that you have all potential new installations before syncing.

:::code-group

```js [Browser]
await client.conversations.syncAll(['allowed']);
```

```js [Node]
await client.conversations.syncAll(['allowed']);
```

```tsx [React Native]
await client.conversations.syncAllConversations(['allowed']);
```

```kotlin [Kotlin]
client.conversations.syncAllConversations(consentState = listOf(ConsentState.ALLOWED))
```

```swift [Swift]
try await client.conversations.syncAllConversations(consentState: [.allowed])
```
