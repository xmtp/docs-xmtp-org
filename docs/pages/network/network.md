# FAQ about the XMTP network

## Is the XMTP network decentralized?

**A testnet of the decentralized XMTP network was launched in early December 2024.** ðŸŽ‰ 

- To learn about the testnet and how the XMTP network will be decentralized, see [Decentralizing XMTP](https://xmtp.org/decentralizing-xmtp).

- To learn about xmtpd (XMTP daemon), the node software that powers the testnet and will power the mainnet of the decentralized XMTP network, see the [xmtpd repo](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtpd).

All of the nodes in the `dev` and `production` XMTP network environments are still operated by [Ephemera](https://ephemerahq.com/) (the company). To explore the software for the nodes that currently form the XMTP network, see the [xmtp-node-go repo](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-node-go).

These network nodes operate in US jurisdiction in compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) export compliance regulations. Accordingly, IP-based geoblocking is in place for the following countries/territories:

- Cuba
- Iran
- North Korea 
- Syria
- The Crimea, Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic, and Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic regions of Ukraine

## Is XMTP a blockchain?

XMTP is not a blockchain. Nodes on the XMTP network run software to store and transfer messages between blockchain accounts. For secure and reliable delivery of messages, the nodes participate in a consensus mechanism.

Ephemera is researching various consensus protocols that would allow the network to operate in a decentralized fashion while maintaining its current emphasis on user privacy and low-latency message delivery.

## Will I be able to run my own XMTP node?

Ephemera is in the process of building the replication mechanisms required to enable third-parties to run XMTP nodes and participate in network decentralization.

To follow and provide feedback on this work, see the [Replication tracking task](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtpd/issues/118) in the [xmtpd repo](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtpd).

## Does XMTP have a token?

XMTP does not currently have a token. Disregard any information regarding airdrops or token sales. If and when an official token is introduced, announcements will be made exclusively through XMTP's official channels.
